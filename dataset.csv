Dear Jennifer,

Thank you for hosting a brown bag lunch session yesterday; your presentation 
was very informative and I believe it led to greater understanding of 
Business Development within GSS.  On a personal level, I was very interested 
in your Continental deal and would like to read a white paper or postmortems 
analysis of the deal after it closes.

I also thank you for taking an active role in this mornings' brown bag, I 
felt like it lent additional credibility to Experience Enron and answered the 
inevitable ""what's in it for me"" questions.

Sincerely,
Jim Wininger","dear jennifer,

PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:



As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

The City League has once again revised our schedule.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the 
team we beat last week, three times during the season and the Raiders only 
once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.  

Have a good weekend,
Brian

Dear Managers, 

Now would be an optimal time to assess the progress or lack of progress of your staff members as it relates to Mid-Year PRC.     

I encourage you to do the following:

?	Ask you direct reports for their current 2001 goals along with a status report of their progress. 
?	Ask your direct reports for a brief self evaluation of their contributions to date for PRC purposes
?	Sit down with your direct reports and talk to them about their areas of improvement that need to addressed and goals that need to be met that will impact the employee at Mid-Year PRC if they are not attained.

This will reduce the chance of miscommunication between you and your employee when you have to deliver difficult messages or where there may be disagreement about current performance levels.      As you already know by now, Frank and I always ask if the issues that are a part of the PRC have been addressed and documented in the recent past with the employee.     Please call us if we can be of any assistance with this process.

Hi, sistas-

Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed ""17"" with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here's a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into
thirds

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to
consider other options.    Thoughts?   -cara

Future NCL Queens,
 Attached are my REVISED suggestions regarding your office and things
relating to hours and awards.  I am attempting to gather my ideas at the end
of my reign and pass them to the appropriate incoming queens.  I have spoken
with some of you regarding these things and given some of you a rough draft
of my suggestions. What you do with these suggestions is between you and the
incoming hours queen, Lady Linda Christy.  Some of these things have been
done, some haven't. I am sending these with Queen Mum's (Pam Stone)
blessing. She has seen the rough draft and asked that the revised go
directly to the new queens.
The incoming hours queen may have input also.  Questions?  Ask.
The soon to be retired hours queen,

I've just looked at some beautiful photos--hand colored done by our project
manager's wife--she is a professional photographer.  How would you all feel
about having a really good, artistic picture done of the three of us for a
gift to Mom and Dad?  Let me know--we could do it while Sally is here for
the shower....

Everything sounds good, but can we use .html instead? .htm doesn't work on
Linux web servers, and it's best to be universal, in case they want to
deploy in diff. contexts.

So that we can avoid last minute ""oh my gosh we've used different file
structures/naming convention--quick we need to change all of these paths in
the next ten minutes"", can we do the following?

All html files will be considered as in the root directory and will use the
extension of "".htm""

Subdirectories/folders:

images--images for Sales Guide and Intro and any image that is used
throughout the deliverable, such as logos, navigation buttons, etc.  So an
example would  be: images/dell_logo.gif

scripts--one script folder for all of the Coursebuilder scripts used in the
deliverable

timer--for the timer interaction that Daniel is building

images/mollie--for images specific to Mollie pages (this way if we have more
than one drag/drop we won't have to rename any Coursebuilder created
images/targets, etc.

images/warren

images/sally

images/david

Will this work for everyone?  If not, please let me know and I will send out
modifications.

find a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance,  so I checked 
notes...you were correct, Pam Martins dad and Emily U. dad were  both

right) probably knows more about car care than  anyone I know...the girls 
call her if their car doesn't start.? Her theory  is that the first thing is 
to turn down the_______ radio as you are backing out  the drive, so you can 
hear your car...pretty basic.?
Summary:? Can we do TT meeting at your house?? I  will email agenda for that

Jeffrey's/Josephine sounds excellent.  I could go for the decorating
thing--that would be fun for me....I still think somethign like a limo is in
order.  It may not be our personalities but I think Mother likes a big
to-do.

okay - I would advise this though:  Since we may all be spending $$ on a
trip on Nov. as well, I think we can be a bit judicious about what we do in
June.   I don't think we need to do anything on the order that we did it 10
years ago . . . I'll be thinking of some restaurant ideas as well.

I tell you what might be nice:   Jeffrey's has a private dining area (think
called Josephine's house) - we had Crockett Int. Christmas there last year -
and Sally had some Enron doo there - I think we could decorate it a bit and
it would be quite nice.   -c.

Sally,

Thought this was good....


Cindy

Hey, here is another wonderful group of facts about women.  I don't
normally like to pass these on but it has too much importance.  Even if
your a skeptic read to the bottom.



Did you know that it's Beautiful Women Month? Well, it is and that means
you.


There are 3 billion women who don't look like supermodels . . .and only
eight who do. Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14. If Barbie was a real woman,
she'd have to walk on all fours due to her proportions. The average woman
weighs 144 lbs and wears between a 9-14. One out of every four college aged
women has an eating disorder. The models in the magazines are airbrushed --
not perfect!

A psychological study in 1995 found that three minutes spent looking at a
fashion magazine caused 70% of women to feel depressed, guilty, and
shameful.  Models twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
Today they  weigh 23% less.
 *****

Beauty of a Woman -

The beauty of a woman
Is not in the clothes she wears,
The figure she carries
Or the way she combs her hair.

The beauty of a woman
Must be seen from her eyes,
Because that is the doorway to her heart,
The place where love resides.

The beauty of a woman
Is not in a facial mole,
But true beauty in a woman
Is reflected in her soul.

It is the caring that she lovingly gives
The passion that she shows,
The beauty of a woman
With passing years - only grows.
 *****

An English professor wrote the words, ""Woman without her man is nothing,"" on
the blackboard and directed the students to punctuate it correctly.  The men
wrote: ""Woman, without her man, is nothing.""   The women wrote: ""Woman!
Without her, man is nothing.""
*****

The Images of Mother -
4 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mommy can do anything!
8 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mom knows a lot!  A whole lot!
12 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mother doesn't really know quite everything.
14 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either.
16 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned.
18 YEARS OF AGE  ~ That old woman? She's way out of date!
25 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.
35 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.
45 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about it?
65 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.

Please send this to five phenomenal women today in celebration of Women's
History Month.  If you do, something good will happen...  You will Boost
another woman's self-esteem.","sally,

Sally - A new idea popped into my head - I don't know if it makes things
easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes:

What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy
- in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the
YO Ranch or somewhere.   We might spend one night or two - plan something
fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad
with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go
somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.

Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more
special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San
Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.

This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but
provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom
and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.    Maybe we could ""chip in""
varying amounts to Mom and Dad's trip so that cindy and richard could afford
it.

Hi, Sal.  Just saying hello.  Hope your interviews at OU went well.   You
are quite the interviewing queen!  Maybe you should write a book (or
article) sometime on ""Keys to Snagging the Right Employee!"".

Good news about Dad, huh?   So glad you were able to get him to see your
doctor to start the ball rolling on finding new answers for him.   It is a
lot of work to find the right answers for our healthcare!

We are starting to think more about the baby's room . . .  I think we're
leaning towards using your bed, if that's still okay.   Did you say that the
changing table would be available, too?  Is it light wood also?
I think we will probably get our own bed linens - but what do your look
like?   Boyish?   Do you think it's better to use a rocker or a glider?

Sorry we didn't make it for a fall trip.   It seems that almost every
weekend one of us has been gone - Chris leaves for Asia on Thursday for 2
weeks - it's a nonstop whirlwind of travel!

Thanksgiving should be fun . . . what shall we bring?     Is there any sort
of a plan for Friday?

I had my monthly doctor's appointment today:  the baby is still in there and
her mom is getting very fat!

I have really enjoyed my Halloween nutcracker this season!      Love, Cara

Hi, Sally...

Wanted to apologize for the way I probably sounded on the phone--lots was
going on here and you caught me at a brain-overload moment!

Thanks for sending the Enron article--thought it was great--brought it in to
the office to show you off here...

Pictures of the girls were much appreciated--can't really believe how old
they look.  Brigeda's has taken possession of them and put them on her
bulletin board--although she wanted BIGGER ones like Grandmom--told her
Grandmoms always got bigger ones....Brigeda gets her picture taken next week
and will send you one--last year's was so dorky we didn't circulate them
much...

Dad actually seemed better yesterday.  He was making jokes and his voice was
a little stronger--he's on pain medication for his tongue--I think giving
him something to make him relax really does help--he wasn't loopy just not
quite so tense.   He seemed very ""up"" for the dr's appt in Houston.  I told
him you asked Fabe for the best ENT in Houston and that this guy was in your
church and did Meagan's tonsils.  He liked all of that information a
lot...thanks again for arranging this.  Mom and I decided if anyone could
get him to a doctor on short notice you would be able to do it--now the
pressure is on!

Hope you have a great weekend--Brigeda and I are looking forward to see you
guys next weekend.

Cindy

Hello, sistas-

Just visited with the coordinator of Josephine's House.   Here's some
additional info. - and we have a few questions to answer:

1) I have reserved the place on my credit card - there will be no actual
charge until the day of the event.

2) For a party of our size, they will offer a choice of soup or salad, 3
entrees and 2 desserts.   If we have a special request, we can let her know;
otherwise the choices will simply be from whatever the Jeffery's chef has
cookin' that night.

3) We need to choose either a soup or a salad for our group.    Preferences?

4) At some point, we will need to decide if we want to do hors deuvres in
addition to the three course meal.   She suggested oysters (for which they
are famous) and then some other, non-seafood appetizer.  These would be
served as guests arrive.

5)  She is faxing me a wine list - and would like to have our selection in
advance of the event.   Also, she asked if we wanted beer and an open bar in
addition to wine.   I told her I'd check with you - but that we wouldn't be
a heavy drinking crowd and that wine would probably be fine.    I thought we
might also want to do champagne - either with the appetizers or sometime
during the meal (maybe dessert?) in case we want to give a toast to the
happy couple.

Thoughts, everyone?      -the youngest and fattest

Hi Sally,

I am so excited to see you and your family.  For your written
records...we'll in be Austin from Oct 27- Oct 31.  Then, we'll travel to
Houston via the Blue Bell ice cream factory on Nov 1st -- our plane leaves
from Houston on Sat, Nov 4th about 12:30.  Doing something on Friday with
Rebecca and Tyler sounds great -- she's pretty much up for anything.

Let me know what you hear from Mo -- it would be wonderful to see her, too.
Paul and I were starting to worry that something bad had happened in her
life!  It has been so long since we have talked to her.

This week's issue of Business Week has Enron in a list of the top 50
companies who are making the Internet work for them in running their
business  -- the focus for Enron was on the different trading operations,
highlighting trading broadband capacity.  I read BW weekly and Enron seems
to be in there a lot.

Take Care,
Stephanie","hi sally,

Dear Sally,

Hope you had a good trip to Dallas, although it was a bit interrupted with
you trip back to Houston for Meagan's Open House.  Dad and I would like be
with you all on Friday the 20th of October.  I believe that may have been the
game we attended last year too.  We have meetings, the other two dates, so if
that still works for you we will plan on that date.  It also gives Dad a bit
more time to hopefully get his voice.  He returns to ""DR"" Bob Raley, week
after next for the results of all the testing he did this week.

Glad you will be over on Tuesday-we will look forward to seeing you then and
glad you will have time for a visit after lunch tool.

Love,

This is Cara's assistant, Cara White.   Cara asked me to send you her
itinerary:

Cara will be in New York for a week.

Thursday through Saturday, she will stay at the Edison Hotel (212) 840-5000

Sunday through Wednesday, she will stay at the Grand Hyatt (she doesn't know
the telephone no. - and I am such a busy personal assistant, I don't have
time to look it up.)

Also, until Sunday, you may try her husband's cell phone (512) 657-1555

You can always try Cara's cell phone (512) 970-0608 - but she hasn't really
figured out how to retrieve messages yet - so you'll probably have better
luck leaving a message at the hotel.

Cara will return on Thursday evening on American Flight #1669, arriving at
4:25 P.M.

Hey guys I need your help

There is one Topic that we still can't seem to get taken care of: S2M1T2.

Sally rewrote the storyboards and, according to my understanding, it was
handed off to Emrul and then Cindy fixed the html pages for the revised
content. But on the server we still have the old version of these files.

What is going on with these files? Gerry would you be able to figure out
what's happening? Did it get to Emrul? Did it get to Cindy? Did it get
posted? Did older versions get copied over the newer versions?

We *need* to get this Topic done for review-- it was due to Linda almost a
week ago. Can you please let me know when it's ready for my review and edit,
so we can get it out to Linda.

Thanks,
Warren","warren,

subject: tracking problem


hey guys i need your help

there is one topic that we still can't seem to get taken care of: s2m1t2.

sally rewrote the storyboards and, according to my understanding, it was
handed off to emrul and then cindy fixed the html pages for the revised
content. but on the server we still have the old version of these files.

what is going on with these files? gerry would you be able to figure out
what's happening? did it get to emrul? did it get to cindy? did it get
posted? did older versions get copied over the newer versions?

we *need* to get this topic done for review-- it was due to linda almost a
week ago. can you please let me know when it's ready for my review and edit,
so we can get it out to linda.

thanks,

Thanks for including me.  Congratulations on Emily.  I know that you and she 
will be getting used to one another over the next few weeks, and that sleep 
will definitely be a scarce commodity.  Those first few weeks can be both 
wonderful and terrible at the same time.  Savor the baby stage as much as you 
can, and before you know it Emily will be cooing and responding to you in a 
way that makes all of the sleepless nights just melt away.  Enjoy your new 
role as mom -- it is a wonderful, life-long experience!  --Sally

...the third time is a charm.  After 2 failed adoptions, God has blessed me 
with a beautiful daughter!  Emily Lyn was born on Saturday, July 8 at 11:18 
am in San Antonio.  She weighed 7 lbs. and measured 19 inches.  She is so 
tiny and has a head full of dark hair!  I brought her home last night at 8:30 
pm.  Our first 
night went well even if I didn't get any sleep.  It's going to take some time 
for me to get used to the noises she makes.  I must admit, there were
days when I never thought this would happen.  I appreciate all the kind words 
of encouragement many of you have shared over the last few years
as I have gone through this process, especially during the really low 
points.  I am truly blessed.
I will be out of the office for a while but feel free to stay in touch as I'm 
sure I'll be logging in often.  Also, if I left someone off the list here, 
please have them forgive me.  Remember, I'm working on 0 sleep.  Please feel 
free to pass this along to anyone I may have fogotten.  Thanks.
Dianne

Just so you can see where my paycheck now goes.  What a great way to spend 
money!
djs


Here are some pictures from the first roll of film - Emily was about 5 or 6 
days old.  She brings me joy I never thought possible.  And I'm sure some day 
she'll bring me some pain, but I'm not thinking about that right now.  I 
didn't know how easy it was to fall in love.  I am a different person 
(better) because of her.  
Yesterday, we made our first trip to the pediatrician and he said that she 
was doing fine.  She gained  7 ounces!  She's quite a good little eater.  We 
are settling into a routine and she sleeps about 4 hours at a time so it 
gives me time to get a fair amount of rest.  We'll probably make a trip down 
to the EB in a few weeks and I'll be sure to let you know exactly when.  I 
hope you all are doing well -- stay in touch.  Here's the pictures.....(by 
the way, the blonde at the hospital with me is my youngest sister, Kerri)

The summer reception has been scheduled at Jalapeno's (same as last
year), 2702 Kirby Drive (just south of Westheimer), 713-524-1668 for
July 26 from 5:30 to 8 pm. I should be receiving the menu options
this week.

Have any of you received sponsorship pledges from your companies? If
you have, please let me know the company and the amount. We still
need some so that we won't have to dip into the reserves. Please also
try asking your classmates who work in Houston about their companies
sponsoring this event. I am also trying at my end.

If you need to reach me: home: 281-218-6598, cell: 713-703-4312

Thanks for your help,

A TOAST TO TEXAS!
As early as 1900, March 2 became a day for Texas Exes to observe as a 
holiday. A
great deal of tradition and sentiment surrounds the celebration
on the local level. In that year, The Ex-Students' Association adopted a 
resolution that:
""Whenever two Texas Exes shall meet on March 2, they shall sit and break 
bread and
pay tribute to the institution that made their education possible."" UT alumni 
all over the
world have followed this tradition. Wherever you are on March 2, 2001, we 
hope you'll
join us in a Texas ""toast"":  To our State, whose founders made our education 
possible;
To Texas Exes who have provided generations of leadership; And to the proud 
tradition
of continued excellence of The University of Texas.Hook'em Horns! For more

Hi, Sal.   Just thinking about the weekend . . .  Any ideas for what we
should do?  Is there a fun place to go to dinner on Saturday?   Sunday is
Father's Day - are you going to want to go to church? (should we bring
clothes?)     Last time I visited you, I decided I would keep the Houston
directions somewhere - but, of course, I don't know where that is.   So,
could you send me directions yet one more time?  THanks!    Love, Cara

Dear Sally,

I decided that this would be the quickest way to get in touch this afternoon,
as I know you must be very busy after taking yesterday off to be with us, and
also I know you will have many things you would like to do at home tonight.
There is no way to say thanks for the great two days.  You are always so
gracious and generous in every way, time, thought, etc.

I really enjoyed going with you to your office and now I can picture you each
day.  I found it very pleasent to sit at your desk.  Please tell Patti that I
enjoyed meeting her.

Thanks so much for taking me to see the interesting shop, and I will look
forward to going there again and using my generous Mother's Day gift
certificate!!  I am still thinking about the table I saw there-it is not a
lot larger than the table I have, but I like the fact that it is a cabinet.

It was very interesting to see your house and what has been done and what you
plan to do with your furnishings.  I think it will be wonderful and I look
forward to seeimg it all finished.  Keep me posted on what is going on and
what decisions you make.  I really do think you and your family will enjoy
the spacious large room.

I do hope David will have good news about his problem and hope that it can be
easily treated.

I thoroughly enjoyed the recital, and I think Amanda played beautifully.
Please tell her that I am so proud of her with the way she is doing in her
music, with the wonderful gold medal, and also doing so great in her school
work.  I hope she has a great two weeks at camp, and I am sure that you will
send me her camp address.  When you have time we can plan her visit time.

It was fun seeing Meagan, and she was very thoughtful to bring Michael by to
see us.  I mentioned to her that if she just wanted a change of scenery after
she goes to camp we would love for her to come over and visit.

Tyler was so much fun too, and especially now that he really knows who we are
and is comfortable with us.  We better stay strong and well so he can have
some visits with us!

I know I probably have forgotten something, but  the visit with you was
great.  Thanks you for being such a loving, thoughtful, and generous
daughter.  I am very proud of you.

Much love,

Mom

Hi, Sal.   Hope you are well.   I was out of town most of last week - and
again Sunday/Monday, so I feel a bit out of it!   How was Meagan's birthday?
Did she pass the driving test?   Did the earrings arrive in time?     Any
other news?   No big news here; just work.  Off to Arlington again on Friday
for a Special Olympics event, then on to a wedding Saturday.   Holiday
Monday.  Yippee!    How do you think the parental units are doing?   (I must
confess, I haven't talked to them too much lately . . . )    love, cara","hi, sal.   hope you are well.   i was out of town most of last week - and

Hi!

Thought about calling you this weekend but thought since you had been gone
most of the week I'd let your family have you all to themselves.

Did want to let you know I am changing jobs week after next.  Will be going
to viviance new education.  They are out of Switzerland.  I, of course,
will work for their N.A. subsidiary.  They are small, with other offices in
ITaly, France, UK, Spain, and Germany.  My passport is ready!

Check them out:  http://www.viviance.net

Will forward new work number to Patti when I am sure of what it will be.
Our offices are on 6th Street on the 2nd and 3rd floor of an old
building...will ride the bus...

Talk to you soon. Hope Canada was cool and your family is doing great.

Sally,
Hope all is well with you guys.   I am excited about our father-daughter
outing to ENRON FIELD later this month.  I understand that there is a person
at Enron who coordinates these events for us.  If you would not mind, would
you give me the person's name.
Eric is in the Boy Scouts and this sounds like an outing that would be
interesting for them also.
Thanks,
Andy","sally,

Hi Sally,

I need to be working on my newest project, for which we went to Hallettsville
this week, and tomorrow is Garden club, and I am almost through as president.
 I will not preside in April, as I have a conflict-new secretary in Colonial
Dames and then all we have left in Garden Club will be our May luncheon.
Being presdent has not been too bad, as all of the ladies are very helpful.
My project is the completion of our papers for the recognition of our
cemetery by the State Historic Commissson .    That is why we were in
Hallettville.  Hope to get that done by Tuesday-there are many attachments
necessary.  We stayed in a Bed and Breakfast, which was fair but not
oustanding breakfast. I ran by to see Dot for a few minutes before we headed
home.  Mary had spent Sunday night with us to go with us and we met our
cousin from Missouri City also.

Enough of that, this will be a great quick way to communicate.  I am glad
Cindy gave me your address.  Hope you have had a great week-end.  I will
write more another time.

Love,

Mom (almost signed it Sue)","hi sally,

Hi, Sal.   Just talked with Cindy and she said you're still trying to work
out weekend plans.   I want to reiterate that, although it would be great to
have you here, please don't make it too hard on yourself.  Don't pressure
yourself to come; I will totally understand if you do not.   If you don't
come this weekend, I bet you will be here soon anyway - because this tummy
is sure to erupt in the near future!    Either way is great.

Just had to go get some more clothes (at Motherhood)  . . . since I am
carrying all of my weight in my belly, it has expanded to epic proportions
and I cannot fit into my pants!

Set up the baby bedding this weekend - it looks really cute!    But I
couldn't figure out what do with the mattress pads (what do the cords fit
around?)   Instead I put that cottony thing with the netting on as a
mattress pad.   Is that what it is for?    I know you explained all of this
to us in December, but we could not take it all in at that time!    love, c.

Sally suggested I forward this resume to you.  Jasmine got in touch with me 
through a mutual friend.  I don't know much about her business potential or 
past performance.  She is currently a contract employee at El Paso and is 
concerned that with the Coastal merger, she will be out of a job.

On a completely selfish note, I will be asking for your support if we hire 
Jasmine to collect my $$$ from HR.

Dear Mr. Taylor:

Per our conversation, I would like to apply for a suitable position in the
Risk Management division.

Since PG&E relocated to Bethesda, MD, I went to work as a contract employee
with El Paso Merchant Energy. Due to the merger of El Paso with
Coastal/Engage, my days are pretty much numbered at El Paso.

I have enclosed my resume for your review.

I thank you for your time and thoughtfulness.

Sincerely,

		 Subject: Associates PRC Meeting - To Be Rescheduled

Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled 
and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning 
Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the 
same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is 
apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to 
cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as 
soon as I know a rescheduled date.  

In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with 
most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, 
accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a 
meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to 
accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have 
provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as 
copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  

With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of 
your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance 
specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to 
me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please 
e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you 
have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name 
and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in 
Houston.  My extension is 35926.

Attached is a resume for a gentleman who has relocated as a trailing expat 
spouse to Houston, who we are looking to find a suitable position somewhere 
in Enron. I know that one or two of you have already seen his resume and at 
the time didn't necessarily have a role for him. I would be very grateful if 
you could take another look and see if anything has now changed.

By way of background, he was previously working with Eastern in the UK in a 
back office capacity looking at their approach to the UK Gas regulatory 
framework known as the Network code. He has done a little consulting work 
since relocating to Houston in the online area. His references are very good. 
He is available with immigration clearance as a local hire, probably at 
Senior Specialist level. As an additional ""incentive"" I would be prepared to 
underwrite his costs in the event you decided in the first 6 months that his 
performance did not meet your expectations (Obviously - I am highly confident 
this will not be the case!).

Jennifer was referred to me by my cousin.  I met her today and she seems like 
a very sharp person.  She is interested in EBS, but is open to other 
opportunities.  I told her about your group, and she was definitely 
interested.  I told her about Strategic Initiatives, but if you explained 
some of the other areas in your group, she might also be interested.

I will be sending her resume to several people, but I think you should talk 
to her based on the needs you continue to describe for your group.  Feel free 
to call her or EMail her at the addresses below.  Also, if there are any 
other people in North America I should send this to, please tell me.  With 
some experience, I  think she could do trading or origination, too.

Call me if you have any questions!

Dear Melissa,

I am a friend Mark and Lynn Richards through a family connection in the
Carolinas.  Mark suggested that I contact you.  Through my own research and
recommendations from peers, I am truly interested in exploring employment
opportunities at Enron.  I am scheduled to meet with David Chang this
Wednesday in order to discuss possibilities in the Broadband area.  If you
are available in the near-term, I would very much appreciate a few minutes
of your time in order to discuss other logical opportunities for someone
with my work experience and educational background.

I am attaching my resume; however, in summary, I am currently working in
Corporate Planning and Development at Reliant Energy.  My responsibilities
include the analysis of potential mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures.
In addition, I work with each business unit within Reliant Energy in order
to create a strategic, long-term forecast for the Company, incorporating
such uncertainties as deregulation in the Texas electricity markets.  Prior
to Reliant Energy, I worked as a Financial Analyst for Esso Caribbean and
Central America in Miami, Florida.  My direct responsibilities included
financial reporting and profitability analyses for Esso affiliates operating
in the Caribbean and Latin America.  I am also a 1997 graduate of
Thunderbird with a concentration in finance and a regional focus on Latin
America.

Please e-mail or call me at your convenience.  My numbers are 713-207-3609
(W) and 713-666-7287 (H).  Thank you very much and I look forward to hearing
from you.  Jennifer Bagwell

carolinas.  mark suggested that i contact you.  through my own research and
recommendations from peers, i am truly interested in exploring employment
opportunities at enron.  i am scheduled to meet with david chang this
wednesday in order to discuss possibilities in the broadband area.  if you
are available in the near-term, i would very much appreciate a few minutes
of your time in order to discuss other logical opportunities for someone
with my work experience and educational background.

i am attaching my resume; however, in summary, i am currently working in
corporate planning and development at reliant energy.  my responsibilities
include the analysis of potential mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures.
in addition, i work with each business unit within reliant energy in order
to create a strategic, long-term forecast for the company, incorporating
such uncertainties as deregulation in the texas electricity markets.  prior
to reliant energy, i worked as a financial analyst for esso caribbean and
central america in miami, florida.  my direct responsibilities included
financial reporting and profitability analyses for esso affiliates operating
in the caribbean and latin america.  i am also a 1997 graduate of
thunderbird with a concentration in finance and a regional focus on latin
america.

please e-mail or call me at your convenience.  my numbers are 713-207-3609
(w) and 713-666-7287 (h).  thank you very much and i look forward to hearing
from you.  jennifer bagwell

Sally,

Thank you again for passing my resume to Ted Murphy. His recruiter is trying
to work the scheduling between myself and the six people that Ted wants me
to meet with. It is all very positive and I appreciate all your help.

I am also very interested in Enron Broadband Services on the commercial
side. With my options and structuring background, I believe that it would be
a great fit. What would be the best way to get my resume in front of Ken
Rice or the right person in his group? I am attaching an electronic copy for
easy forwarding.

Thank you

Rob

Dear Ms. Beck,

A couple weeks ago I sent you a letter and resume regarding the possibility
of a summer internship.  As I know how easy it is for things to get lost in
email, I am sending them again.  The letter follows and the resume is
attached.  If this job position will not work out or if I should contact
someone else, please let me know.  I will also try to call you to follow-up
within the next two days.
Thanks you for your time.

Sincerely,
Natalie Carnes

Dear Ms. Beck,

I am writing to you to express my interest in working for Enron.  I have
long been interested in a career in business, and I would love the
opportunity to explore business in Enron this summer.

As I have worked with the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club (HEC) and various
entrepreneurs association around the country to spearhead the effort to
form a national collegiate entrepreneurs organization, I have learned a
great deal about how organizations work and how to make them effective.
This theme of entrepreneurship has spilled over into my other activities as
well.  I am coordinating the first annual fundraising banquet for Christian
Impact to help us raise money for outreach events.  I am also co-leading
the first mission trip comprised of Harvard students this summer.  Because
this effort is taking me to Latin America for the first half of the summer,
I will be in Houston from mid-July to mid-September.  If there is a
position available at Enron, I would enjoy working for it while I am here.

I am excited about the opportunity to learn more about the business world.
The combination of resourcefulness, rigorous logic, and creativity called
for in the business sphere intrigues me.  The integration of global and
analytical thinking also piques my interest. I have attached my resume for
you to review, I will be in Houston from March 27-31 if you would like to
interview me. Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing
from you!

Sincerely,

Natalie Carnes

opportunity to explore business in enron this summer.

as i have worked with the harvard entrepreneurs club (hec) and various
entrepreneurs association around the country to spearhead the effort to
form a national collegiate entrepreneurs organization, i have learned a
great deal about how organizations work and how to make them effective.
this theme of entrepreneurship has spilled over into my other activities as
well.  i am coordinating the first annual fundraising banquet for christian
impact to help us raise money for outreach events.  i am also co-leading
the first mission trip comprised of harvard students this summer.  because
this effort is taking me to latin america for the first half of the summer,
i will be in houston from mid-july to mid-september.  if there is a
position available at enron, i would enjoy working for it while i am here.

i am excited about the opportunity to learn more about the business world.
the combination of resourcefulness, rigorous logic, and creativity called
for in the business sphere intrigues me.  the integration of global and
analytical thinking also piques my interest. i have attached my resume for
you to review, i will be in houston from march 27-31 if you would like to

Dear Ms. Beck,

I am writing to you to express my interest in working for Enron.  I have
long been interested in a career in business, and I would love the
opportunity to explore business in Enron this summer.

As I have worked with the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club (HEC) and various
entrepreneurs association around the country to spearhead the effort to
form a national collegiate entrepreneurs organization, I have learned a
great deal about how organizations work and how to make them effective.
This theme of entrepreneurship has spilled over into my other activities as
well.  I am coordinating the first annual fundraising banquet for Christian
Impact to help us raise money for outreach events.  I am also co-leading
the first mission trip comprised of Harvard students this summer.  Because
this effort is taking me to Latin America for the first half of the summer,
I will be in Houston from mid-July to mid-September.  If there is a
position available at Enron, I would enjoy working for it while I am here.

I am excited about the opportunity to learn more about the business world.
The combination of resourcefulness, rigorous logic, and creativity called
for in the business sphere intrigues me.  The integration of global and
analytical thinking also piques my interest. I have attached my resume for
you to review, I will be in Houston from March 27-31 if you would like to
interview me. Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing
from you!

Sincerely,

Natalie Carnes

Steve/Daren,

I interviewed this candidate and REALLY liked her.  She has previous 
allocations and settlements experience, but really wants to do financial 
accounting.  As you will see on her resume, she is doing internal auditing at 
Foleys.  She was honest with me that she did not necessarily want to do 
allocations again and that she really enjoyed working with the schedulers and 
traders, although she doesn't necessarily want to schedule or trade.  She 
mentioned Risk specifically.  I think she would be an asset to Enron.  Please 
use at your discretion.  Thanks!

Good afternoon everyone,

I would like to present Megan Jones for consideration of the Sr. Specialist
position (Job 103143)
As for your essential requirements, she meets and exceeds them all.
Accounting degree from UT, very detailed, knowledge of the gas industry,
EXCELLENT communication skills,  and over 2 years of experience.
Regarding essential functions, she could perform them right away.  Her
resume shows detail of experience.
Megan left Coral Energy to get into a department at Sonat which would
provide her more of a challenge.  She was truly being utilized as a
""bean-counter"" and wanted more interaction with others.  She went to work at
Sonat which she says is the best job she ever had.  She enjoyed the company,
people, everything...  As you know, Sonat was bought by El Paso which ended
her position along with others in her department.
She honestly took her current position in haste, but also thought it would
give her the experience of using her accounting skills, but having more
interaction with others in an audit capacity.  This has not been the case.
She misses the industry, and learns quickly, very social and has no problem
interacting with people at all levels.
Let me know your thoughts and any questions you may have.
Best Regards,
Sharon

All,

Intern referral from Mike McConnell.  Not sure his background/education is a 
fit for Technology?  Maybe other groups are looking for summer interns with 
some energy related experience.  He worked last summer at Dynegy in gas 
control and scheduling.

Please let me know if you have any interest.

Thanks,

Robert

Subject:  Resume for Summer Internship

April 20, 2000

Dear Mr. McConnell:

Thank you for taking the time to consider this resume for a possible summer
internship with Enron.  I understand that you have spoken to my father, Scott
Wells at Texaco, and he has informed me that Enron accepts interns only when
a department asks for one.

I'd like to continue my education in the energy industry for a second summer.
 I interned for Dynegy last summer and learned many new concepts and terms
for working in the gas industry.  I worked on the trading floor as a gas
scheduler, and after only a month I was controlling the northeast CNG
pipeline.  This helped because I really got to learn were many of the
northeast pipes are located and different pooling and connecting points.

Other responsibilities were inputting numbers into the morning spreadsheet of
the gas bought and sold that morning.  Throughout the day I would work on
projects they needed completed and attend meetings that pertained to the
trading floor.  It was all a great learning experience for me and I hope to
use my knowledge again this summer for Enron.

I would appreciate your help in forwarding my resume to the proper Human
Resource personnel so that I might be able to contact him or her in hopes of
a future internship possibility.  I will be available to have a start date of
May 15th and be available for employment until school resumes in late August.
 Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from someone in your
company at his/her earliest convenience.  Please feel free to call me at
940-323-0891, or email me at Rollins50@aol.com.

Sincerely-


Sean Wells

Subject: Re: Summer Internship Position

Hi Vince, Paulo Oleira (one of the M.I.T attending our meeting on wed)'s 
research interest turned out to be a match for April Hodgeson (VP of content 
origination). I had him talk to April (Stinson was on the call as well) to 
discuss his research interest and what he would likely to do for April.  I 
suggested (and April agrees) that Paulo would intern with her and Matt and 
perform research on how end users (consumers and business) improved 
experience with ePowered content can be quantified.  This may include 
performing control experiments at M.I.T.  We decided not to over specify what 
he would do since it is likely to change as soon as he arrives.  I suggested 
once he starts, he will work with April and Matt Harris (VP enterprise 
origination) and they will define what the student needs to complete for the 
internship.  

Addiontionally, Tom Gros agrees that this type of research are needed and 
this is a great way to start.

I will proceed to have recruiting contact the student with an offer to start 
around May 22, 2000 unless someone tells me otherwise.

Regards,

Ravi.

P.S. Charlene, please include Paulo in your May 22, 2000 start group.  Paulo 
will report to me within EBS research group but will work on a day-to-day 
basis with April and Matt. As you've mentioned that compensation is somewhat 
fixed but please keep in mind that this person is a PhD candidate with very 
specialized skill set. Please contact Vince before extending an offer that 
may be too low, etc.

Stinson,

I have accepted an amended offer from Southern Company Energy
Marketing.  My decision was based on the higher compensation, and the
opportunity to rotate through structuring, trading and research.  I am
very confident that I would have been very engaged and happy working in
your group; I did not take the decision lightly.

I'll be moving to Atlanta in March, but I will keep the email and URL

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

Thank you for your help,

Jinbaek,

May 30 sounds good. I shall inform our HR department.

I don't see any project I could get going with your advisor on such a short
notice.

When you come here you can determine in what area he could make
the biggest contribution to Enron. I shall call or E-mail
him independently and talk to him.

Vince

Dr. Kaminski,
I think I'll be able to start work from the last week of May,
but not from monday,
probably, I'll be able to work from 5/30 (wed).
Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4
I am sorry.

And actually, there is an e-business conference at Haas school of business,
organized by my advisor
Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e-business and especially procurement?
The link is as following.
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/

I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email...
My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu)
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer, while I am staying there.
His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?)
and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace...
XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk ..
system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system,
e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc...
many technical aspects of e-business...
He wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both ENRON and him.
He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the
summer.
(And to be frankly, this will be good for me too,
because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..)
Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?

Thank you..

Sincerely,
Jinbaek

Dr. Kaminski,
thanks for your mail.

I am sorry that I'll not be available earlier,
I will talk with my advisor, but
probably it will be pretty negative.
however, I may be able to start it from June1,
depending on what he tells..
We will meet tomorrow afternoon,
so I'll be able to let you know
whether we can start work earlier then.

And could you tell me briefly
what are those projects you have in mind?

Thanks!

dr. kaminski,
thanks for your mail.

i am sorry that i'll not be available earlier,
i will talk with my advisor, but
probably it will be pretty negative.
however, i may be able to start it from june1,
depending on what he tells..
we will meet tomorrow afternoon,
so i'll be able to let you know
whether we can start work earlier then.

and could you tell me briefly
what are those projects you have in mind?

thanks!

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in 
becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab 
experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back 
to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the 
attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel 
I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the 
qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

By the way, the chapter you sent has been VERY helpful to me in coming to
understand Enron's early history.  ""I'm getting it"" even if slowly.

Hi John and Vince!

John, hopefully you received my voice mail regarding the matter set forth 
below.

I'm in NY now and won't  return until Thursday morning.  Perhaps it would be 
easiest for John to come to the video conference on Thursday (if he's in 
Houston) or via telephone if he's travelling??

Whatever  you both think is best..please let me know!

My assistant, Melinda McCarty, is setting up the call location at the Enron 
Building, as well as the dial-in number with Donna Piazze at Wharton.

Melinda, please include John in the distribution of the video conference 
location.

Thanks!

Christie,

As we talked last Thursday via video teleconference, we are planning to 
narrow our scope to focus on a marketing/promotion plan for NewPower 
including value-added products and services for the future.  Before we talk 
again on Thursday, we would like to speak with John Henderson again to see if 
he recommends any specific items he would like us to address.

We are having trouble contacting him and wonder if you could facilitate a 
phone meeting between us, or if it would be best to include him in our next 
video teleconference.  We are available the next two days at 1pm and 4pm 
Houston time.

We understand that John is a very busy person, and we appreciate any help you 
can give in getting us together to ensure our work is commensurate with his 
expectations.

Thanks,

Li,

Globally there are probably over 80 ""competitors"" to EOL.  None of these 
competitors have a meaningful market share.  Some of the names that jump to 
mind are the following, but it should be easy to find others by surfing the 
web.  Good luck.

Vince,
I must apologize to you about the version of the paper i sent last evening.
i was pretty exhausted from the day and didn't stop to give it a proof
reading (on paper). I still find that screen editing is a poor substitute
for holding the paper and marking it up.
There is still work to be done but I think the paper is improving with each
iteration. I want to work more on documenting the specific ""events leading
up to the formation of the new unregulated business"" including some
documentation on the deregulation process and events in the natural gas
market. Specifically, I remember conversations about ""take or pay"" contract
defaults, etc. and the financial crisis they created. Also, Gene Humphries
commented in a round table discussion that Sheridan held at UT that Carl
Ichan made a play for Enron and this was fended off with a leveraged ESOP.
I would like to get all the details to these issues to better ""set up the
section on marching to the beat of a new drummer"".
I hope this process isn't too frustrating for you. I am convinced that we
will winnow out the story in the end if we persevere.
Have a great weekend.
your friend,
john

Hi Anne!

Thank you for your reply.  Enron is delighted to be a part of the Wharton 
Business Plan Competition!

First, our assistant in the University Affairs Group, Melinda McCarty, will 
provide you with our logo.

Enron would definitely like to be Judge in Phase III and Participate in the 
Venture Fair, including the display table.

As to the mentoring and University community program, let;s discuss that 
further so I can better judge our way forward.

After I've had the chance to discuss all of this with our entire University 
Affairs and Wharton team here at Enron, you and I can get together to plan a 
more difinitive participatory strategy for Enron.  I will call you next week.

Again, we at Enron are very enthusiastic about participation with Wharton in 
this mutually interesting endeavor.!

Dear Christie:

Thank you for your voice mail. Things  are moving along nicely with the 
competition.   Phase II deadline was today, so we hope to have some 
statistics in the next few weeks.  I have attached the statistics from Phase 
I, for your files.  Listed below are ways that Enron could be involved, let 
me know in which (or all) of these Enron would be interested in participating.

* We want to start listing our sponsors, so it would be really good if we 
could get your logo.

* Also, does Enron wish to be a Judge in Phase III and the Venture Fair 
(VF)?  For Phase III, we would mail each Judge about 3 full blown business 
plans to be ranked. We anticipate this taking no more than 1 afternoon

*  For the VF, we would need a Judge to be present for the entire day.   The 
VF is by invitation only and we anticipate about 350 students, venture 
capitalists, business entrepreneurs and faculty.  The VF will be held in 
Philadelphia on April 30th.

* At the VF we will provide an opportunity for our sponsors with a 6 foot 
table for exhibits or materials to hand out.  We will need to know if you 
wish to use the exhibit space.

*  We plan on providing our 25 semi-finalist teams with one-on-one 
mentoring.  If Enron is interested, that would be about 1/2 or 1 day 
commitment.

*  There might be an opportunity for a workshop to the University community.  
Would Enron be interested in participating in something like this?

I look forward to working with you to make this year's BPC a success.  Thank 
you.

Sincerely,


Anne Stamer

","hi anne!

thank you for your reply.  enron is delighted to be a part of the wharton 
business plan competition!

first, our assistant in the university affairs group, melinda mccarty, will 
provide you with our logo.

enron would definitely like to be judge in phase iii and participate in the 
venture fair, including the display table.

as to the mentoring and university community program, let;s discuss that 
further so i can better judge our way forward.

after i've had the chance to discuss all of this with our entire university 
affairs and wharton team here at enron, you and i can get together to plan a 
more difinitive participatory strategy for enron.  i will call you next week.

again, we at enron are very enthusiastic about participation with wharton in 
this mutually interesting endeavor.!

best regards!

Vince,

I shipped you the paper along with my note to Don.  However, I wanted to
share with you what I feel are the remaining ""to dos"".  Specifically,

1.  We need to document carefully the forces that were behind the original
transformation of Enron.  Specifically, the fallout from deregulation (take
or pay contract defaults, etc.), the impact of the losses from the oil
trading operation, the nationalization of the Peruvian pipeline, and the
leveraging up to fend off the Carl Ichan takeover attempt.

2.  We need to complete/beef up the network strategy section.

3.  Finally, the concluding section needs to be carefully crafted to
""hammer home"" the basic principles underlying the transformation.

What do you think?

Hope you have a great weekend.

Don,

Attached is my latest effort.  It entailed fairly drastic ""restructuring
and reorganization"" of the earlier draft.  My revision effort has been
directed at improving the focus of the paper.  The new story is the following:

1.  Enron was formed as a regulated gas pipeline company in the mid-eighties.
2.  Economic and competitive conditions conspired to force a dramatic
reorganization of the company almost immediately.  The result was the
creation of a new, unregulated energy trading operation.  The strategy of
the new unit was to capitalize on business opportunities in the
deregulation of markets that was occuring at the time (mid-eighties until
now).
3.  The business model adopted for the new unregulated business was that of
a ""gas bank"".  The analogy to a commercial bank posed a very difficult
problem to Enron's management in that there was no source of liquidity to
the market from a central bank authority.  As a consequence Enron had to
develop its own very elaborate risk management procedures.
4.  Another consequence of the new business model was that it required a
different set of employee skills and talents.  Specifically, it required
were bright, energetic and innovative individuals capable of identifying
entrepreneurial opportunities and starting new businesses.  Furthermore, a
new, flatter organizational structure entailing decentralized decision
making was required to facilitate quick response to changing market
conditions.  To monitor and manage this new ""empowered"" labor force
required that the firm develop new personnel policies and procedures.
5.  Three primary tools of personnel management were adopted:  (i) measure
performance semi-annually, (ii) tie compensation closely to performance,
and (iii) allow personnel free movement within Enron to seek out the best
opportunities.
6.  Other attributes of the Enron model include consideration for asset
optionality, recognition of the value of networks in adding value to
trading platforms, and the use of mark-to-market accounting for business
transactions as a means of ensuring transparency and promoting prompt actions.

If my ""story line"" sounds better than the draft I have attached its because
its the last thing I've written.  At any rate I look forward to hearing
your comments and to getting this wrapped up.

Thanks and i look forward to seeing you in February.

John

I have forwarded the resume to our Analysts / Associate pool with
a recommendation to accept David as a summer intern.

I expressed interest in taking him into my group. He may, of course,
work for a different unit of Enron. It's up to him and I shall not be
offended
if he would like to go into trading or deal origination.

Vince and Christie:

Again, many thanks for inviting and hosting the Tiger Team for an on-site
visit.  It was a wonderful opportunity to meet and attend the very
informative briefings from the many senior level contacts you provided to
learn more about Enron overall. It was enlightening and exciting to learn so
much about Enron.  What a great company!  The trip got rave reviews from the
students.  You were delightful and most accommodating hosts.

As for the project, I am in the process of confirming dates and locations
for the weekly Thursday (4:00-6:00pm EST) videoconferences with Enron and
will copy you on the email to the students. I know they are anxious to begin
to narrow the scope as soon as possible so that can begin the research and
analysis of their particular projects.

Thank you for your time and support of the project.

Vince,

Two items.  Unless you have an objection, I plan to ship the paper on to
Don Chew at the journal this morning.  We can still work on the article but
he needs something to begin the editing process.

Second, in the same issue as our paper will appear the transcript of a
roundtable discussion involving Sheridan titman, John McCormack (Stern
stewart), Ron Erd (Southern Energy), Jeff Sandifer (president of sandifer
capital--$700 million undermanagement), and Gene Humphries.  Attached you
will find a section THAT WILL NOT BE IN THE FINAL DOCUMENT, but that I
thought you might like to read in light of our own discussions over the
course of writing this paper.

Have a great day.

Dear Jeff,

Our tiger team very much enjoyed your presentation about Enron Global Markets 
on Friday.  Given that we have latitude in our project scope, our team would 
like to assist Enron in evaluating a new market opportunity.  You mentioned 
several markets that Enron is considering in 2001, including transportation, 
cement, coffee, cocoa, sugar, etc.  We believe that a project of this sort 
will give us the opportunity to really learn how Enron creates value, what 
its business model and core competencies are, and how they can be translated 
to a new market.  Furthermore, we can get an in-depth understanding of an 
industry.  We believe our project will complement any analysis that your 
business group is currently undertaking.  Please propose the top three new 
markets that you would like us to evaluate for Enron.

Upon receipt of your proposal, perhaps we could set up a conference call to 
discuss your thoughts and to make a final selection.

Your expeditious response is appreciated.

Regards,

Josh Leventhal

Subject: Corn Subsidy Govt Program Analysis

Hi Vince,

 Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go 
forward on the analysis and presentation for this program.  The consensus 
from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically 
driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close 
ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures.  Also it is 
preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending 
more credibility in the Ag community.  The names that came up were 
Mississippi State and Texas A&M.  Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi 
State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues.
 The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is 
primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron 
can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to 
cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the 
govt will want to worry about basis risk). 
 The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing 
down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination.  
Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination 
side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent 
of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.

Vasant

p.s. I am writing up Jim Bouillion's project suggestion as a potential 
project for Wharton.  Of course, we may still ask Wharton for their insights 
on the corn price protection approach.

Vince,

This is my latest effort and I would appreciate your thoughts.  I know that
we haven't written together before so let me assure me that you will not
hurt my feelings by ""slashing away"" with a red pen.  I think that I have
put all the clay on the table for this piece of sculpture but it is still
pretty crude.  Help me ""refine"" the work to create something we can both be
very proud of.

By the way, I know you are extremely busy right now so don't feel pressured
to spend lots of time here.  Any guidance you can offer will be
appreciated.  I don't know what the editor's time schedule is but he asked
me to send him a draft on Monday.  You and I will still be able to edit the
manuscript but he will begin reading and editing it too.  I'll let you know
as soon as I have a final deadline.

Your friend,

John

p.s. Hope life is a bit calmer for you.  By the way, I'm reading an
interesting book entitled ""The Four Agreements"" by Miguel Ruiz that
documents the Toltec philosophy of life in the context of the dreams of
reality that we all create.  You might enjoy it.

Friends,

Attached below are please find:

1. Wharton Tiger team Agenda, Friday, 19 January 2001, 7:30 am - 4:30 pm;

2. Wharton Tiger Team Brochure (explaining the program).

Thank you in advance for your participation.  Meeting room 32 C 2  will be 
equipped for computer presentations.  The format of your presentation is 
entirely up to you--formal, conversational, computerized, hard copy--however 
you feel most comfortable.  We're currently expecting a total of 18 in the 
group.

Everyone is invited to come to Churrasco's this evening.  The Wharton group 
will be picked up from the Warwick at 6:30, so should arrive at the 
restaurant at about 6:45-7p.  Please come if you can!

Thanks again!  This is an enthusiastic, talented group of prospective Enron 
recruits--and their research efforts might also well prove interesting to our 
businesses .

Regards--  Christie.

Hi Jaideep!

My first suggestion is that you come to Houston as scheduled (and arranged 
with Wharton nearly 3 weeks ago).  Alternatively, rely on your Tiger 
teammates to gather information necessary to respond to the project.  Should 
circumstances lead you to decide not to come for this trip, please return the 
ticket issued to you.  Should it make sense for you to visit Enron some time 
in the future, we can discuss arrangements at that time.

Hope to see you soon!

--Christie.

Hello Christie,

Thank you for organizing the Wharton trip to Enron.  Unfortunately, the
flight setup for tomorrow is way too early for me as I'll have to miss over
4 hours of classes, which I cannot afford to do.  I tried changing the time
with Continental and there latest flight leaves at 6PM - which does not work
for me (smack in the middle of my 3 hour class)

Thus the dilemma that I find myself in is the following:

a. Try a different flight as I can make any flight after 7:30PM (however, I
have no control over reservations/budget etc)
b. As it is possible to delay travel upto 1 year, use this ticket to come
some other time

Sorry for this but I just saw the  bookings today.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Jaideep

circumstances lead you to decide not to come for this trip, please return the 
ticket issued to you.  should it make sense for you to visit enron some time 
in the future, we can discuss arrangements at that time.

hope to see you soon!

hello christie,

thank you for organizing the wharton trip to enron.  unfortunately, the
flight setup for tomorrow is way too early for me as i'll have to miss over
4 hours of classes, which i cannot afford to do.  i tried changing the time
with continental and there latest flight leaves at 6pm - which does not work
for me (smack in the middle of my 3 hour class)

thus the dilemma that i find myself in is the following:

a. try a different flight as i can make any flight after 7:30pm (however, i
have no control over reservations/budget etc)
b. as it is possible to delay travel upto 1 year, use this ticket to come
some other time

sorry for this but i just saw the  bookings today.

any suggestions?

thanks,
jaideep

Hi, Vince,

This is Li, writing from U. of Chicago.
I am in the second quarter here.
The study and social life is extremely busy at the school.
But I enjoy connecting the knowledge I learn everyday here
with the experience I had with Enron.

A schoolmate of mine, a Chicago Ph.D. candidate in finance,
is looking for an internship for the coming summer.
I recommend him to write to you to see if you are interested in
or if there is a need. If so, you can contact with him directly.
He is a really bright guy. If not, hope you don't mind that
I sell Enron at school so hard.

Again, thanks for all the help you gave me.
Have a good new year.

Li

P.S.: Cover letter below and resume attached.

Hi Vince,

Re: my voice mail sent earlier today, I think this is the group requesting 
the telephone conference.

They prefer a call Tuesday, 16 Jan, after 2 pm.

Let me know!

Thanks!

Dear Vince / Christie,

Thanks for coming to Philadelphia to present an overview of the projects. We 
enjoyed meeting you and your colleagues and look forward to working with 
Enron.  I would also like to pass on my team's appreciation for the dinner as 
well.

We wanted to give you an update on our project and get some feedback and 
additional information prior to our upcoming visit to Houston on January 
19th. Our project is going to be geared to the 3rd option you mentioned.  We 
plan on addressing some part of the Retail Energy Services business.  We are 
considering two options regarding this topic and would like to pursue either
(i)how customers are acquired and recommending new processes and ways to 
serve retail customers, OR
(ii) studying the supply chain and coming up with recommendations for areas 
for further investments.

However, we would like to get some more information on the Retail Energy 
Services before truly scoping the project.  We are also very open to 
suggestions, especially if you had a much broader or different scope in mind; 
so please let us know.

We have not yet reviewed the introductory information received last week, but 
here are the questions we have specific to the Retail Energy Services unit:

Can we look at its overall business plan or a more detailed summary than is 
in the annual report?
What is the pricing philosophy/overall structure?
Who are the customers and how are they acquired?
What would the customers be doing if they did not work with Enron?
What are the international expansion plans and capabilities?
Is there any important regulatory summary information we can have?

If this information is not already covered in the review material you sent, 
will you be able recommend other sources where we may find such information?

After we have reviewed the material sent to us recently, we may want to 
schedule a phone call with you and/or one of your colleagues directly 
involved in the Retail Energy Services business.  I would like to call you in 
the new year to discuss this further.  In the meantime, please feel free to 
call me at (215) 546-9416 if you need any information.

Regards,

Vince,

I have added a lot of material to ""fill in the wholes"" and would like your
reaction to the current draft.  I am still not very happy with the risk
management segment (primarily as a result of my own lack of knowledge) so
please read it carefully and get me your comments.

I plan to let Don Chew (the editor) take a look at it to give us his
guidance toward a successful draft.

Hope you are having a great day and tremendous start to the new year.

Your friend

john

p.s. I really enjoyed your papers.  those should definitely be part of a
class on risk management.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our ""New Era"" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Best Regards,

Hi Vince and Happy New Year
Good to hear from you and I can understand being busy. I am myself trying to
balance my commitments here.

Like any research consortium Pserc is trying to provide value to its members
while walking the fine line between cooperation and competition. We are
definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the
members but rather working on more generic areas that later individual
members could see way to convert to proprietary tools. The work that Shijie
Deng and Rajnish Kamat have been doing with me are good examples.

As to my trip, thanks for the invitation but I already committed myself to
get back Friday night so I will save my visit for another time.

I will tell my son about the spring interviews at Cornell. Hopefully this
time he will not miss it.

Regards, Shmuel

Hello Shmuel,

Thanks for your message. The end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 were 
extremely busy 
and I could not focus on PSERC issues. I shall consult a few people in Enron 
on this subject and get in
touch with you. Our concern right now is that the results of research are 
widely shared with
our competition.

I am out on the 19th, but the 20th would work for me. I would be glad to 
cover the cost of your Austin
to Houston trip.

Regarding your son. The Analyst / Associate program will interview again on 
the campus
in the spring and they will be more than happy to interview him.

Hello Vince
Happy Holidays.
I wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of Enron Joining
PSERC. As you might have heard from Lance and Alex we are going through a
transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry
members within the last year. Consequently, our business processes are not
well developed. One of the problems we are facing is the balance between the
electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested
in market related research. I hope to recruit more of the later so tat we
have more of a constituency in the Advisory Board  that sees the value of
market related research. I already have a verbal commitment from people at
Electrabell that expressed interest in joining PSERC. With members like
Electrabell and Enron we will be able to support more market Stem projects
such as the one that Shijie Deng proposed (not funded in this round). Please
let me know if I can do anything to facilitate the decision at Enron. I am
going to be in Austin on January 19 to participate at a PUCT hearing and
could come through Huston for a visit. Attached are some items that I shared
with our PSERC members and thought that you might be interested in them as
well.

","hello shmuel,

thanks for your message. the end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 were 
extremely busy 
and i could not focus on pserc issues. i shall consult a few people in enron 
on this subject and get in
touch with you. our concern right now is that the results of research are 
widely shared with
our competition.

i am out on the 19th, but the 20th would work for me. i would be glad to 
cover the cost of your austin
to houston trip.

regarding your son. the analyst / associate program will interview again on 
the campus
in the spring and they will be more than happy to interview him.

subject: fw: pserc nuggets related to market stem


hello vince
happy holidays.
i wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of enron joining
pserc. as you might have heard from lance and alex we are going through a
transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry
members within the last year. consequently, our business processes are not
well developed. one of the problems we are facing is the balance between the
electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested
in market related research. i hope to recruit more of the later so tat we
have more of a constituency in the advisory board  that sees the value of
market related research. i already have a verbal commitment from people at
electrabell that expressed interest in joining pserc. with members like
electrabell and enron we will be able to support more market stem projects
such as the one that shijie deng proposed (not funded in this round). please
let me know if i can do anything to facilitate the decision at enron. i am
going to be in austin on january 19 to participate at a puct hearing and
could come through huston for a visit. attached are some items that i shared
with our pserc members and thought that you might be interested in them as
well.
regards, shmuel.

Friends,

Attached is the ""Final"" draft of the Harvard Business School case study 
prepared by Harvard Professor Chris Bartlett and his research assistant Meg 
Wozny. [please scroll down to the end of the next message for the attachment] 
.  The content was developed from interviews with most of you.

Please review the case and let me know of any desired 
edits/corrections/comments as soon as possible. [One obvious correction is 
the spelling of Cindy Olson's last name].

We'd like to ""sign off"" on this within the next 2 or 3 days. Harvard 
professors are excited about teaching this case this coming semester.  In 
fact, Professor Don Sull will be focusing largely on this Enron Case this 
semester, culminating in ""Enron Day"" at Harvard Business School April 26th, 
featuring Jeff Skilling. Also, Chris and Meg will be in Houston this 
Thursday, Jan. 11th, 'capping off' their work with video interviews with Ken, 
Jeff and Louise, which will help ""bring the case to life"" for the students 
studying it.

Please forward any edits/corrections/comments to me via E-Mail or via hard 
copy (please deliver to EB 4710, or call me [3-6117] and we'll have it picked 
up).

Thanks  to everyone for all your contributions to this exciting work!

--Christie.

Congratulations!  I don't know how you manage to work full-time at Enron
and study for a PhD at the same time.  Sounds superhuman to me!

The FedEx was marked for Saturday delivery, but in case you haven't
received it yet, I'm enclosing the draft as an attachment.
It would be great if we could get Enron's approval during our visit.  (I
know professors at HBS are interested in teaching that case as soon as it's
available.)

Thanks for all your help, and let me know if you have any questions,
comments, etc.
Best,
Meg

Happy New Year. I hope the first few weeks of this year will see the 
completed paper. 

I am sending you the last version of the paper I have received with a few 
comments (in red). I think it makes sense to discuss the paper over the

Please excuse the cancellation due to illness.  The students do not care
who
they infect near the end of the semester, they just want to get done!

Here is my available schedule for next year.  I am now overloaded next week
with tasks to complete the semester.  I do hope that we can reschedule
during the first quarter next year.

I would note that my schedule is most free for Thursday or Friday.  I could
fly out late Wednesday night.

Cordially,

Dear Vince / Christie,

Thanks for coming to Philadelphia to present an overview of the projects. We 
enjoyed meeting you and your colleagues and look forward to working with 
Enron.  I would also like to pass on my team's appreciation for the dinner as 
well.

We wanted to give you an update on our project and get some feedback and 
additional information prior to our upcoming visit to Houston on January 
19th. Our project is going to be geared to the 3rd option you mentioned.  We 
plan on addressing some part of the Retail Energy Services business.  We are 
considering two options regarding this topic and would like to pursue either
(i)how customers are acquired and recommending new processes and ways to 
serve retail customers, OR
(ii) studying the supply chain and coming up with recommendations for areas 
for further investments.

However, we would like to get some more information on the Retail Energy 
Services before truly scoping the project.  We are also very open to 
suggestions, especially if you had a much broader or different scope in mind; 
so please let us know.

We have not yet reviewed the introductory information received last week, but 
here are the questions we have specific to the Retail Energy Services unit:

Can we look at its overall business plan or a more detailed summary than is 
in the annual report?
What is the pricing philosophy/overall structure?
Who are the customers and how are they acquired?
What would the customers be doing if they did not work with Enron?
What are the international expansion plans and capabilities?
Is there any important regulatory summary information we can have?

If this information is not already covered in the review material you sent, 
will you be able recommend other sources where we may find such information?

After we have reviewed the material sent to us recently, we may want to 
schedule a phone call with you and/or one of your colleagues directly 
involved in the Retail Energy Services business.  I would like to call you in 
the new year to discuss this further.  In the meantime, please feel free to 
call me at (215) 546-9416 if you need any information.

Hi!

Attached please find the Itinerary for the Harvard---NYU trip; please 
disregard any parts of the trip that don't apply to you.

If I have not already done so, I'll try this morning to get you a copy of the 
Enron OnLine case being taught at Harvard tomorrow (Thursday).  Otherwise, 
I'll give it to you on the plane--it's fewer than 15 pages, so it's a quick 
read.

Please call me if you have any questions (3-6117).  Otherwise, I'll see you 
at the corporate hangar at 6pm. 

(For anyone unfamiliar with the location of the corporate hangar, I believe 
you can get a map/address/directions from the Enron Aviation department.)

Thanks!

--Christie.

enron.  i would also like to pass on my team's appreciation for the dinner as 
well.

we wanted to give you an update on our project and get some feedback and 
additional information prior to our upcoming visit to houston on january 
19th. our project is going to be geared to the 3rd option you mentioned.  we 
plan on addressing some part of the retail energy services business.  we are 
considering two options regarding this topic and would like to pursue either
(i)how customers are acquired and recommending new processes and ways to 
serve retail customers, or
(ii) studying the supply chain and coming up with recommendations for areas 
for further investments.

however, we would like to get some more information on the retail energy 
services before truly scoping the project.  we are also very open to 
suggestions, especially if you had a much broader or different scope in mind; 
so please let us know.

we have not yet reviewed the introductory information received last week, but 
here are the questions we have specific to the retail energy services unit:

can we look at its overall business plan or a more detailed summary than is 
in the annual report?
what is the pricing philosophy/overall structure?
who are the customers and how are they acquired?
what would the customers be doing if they did not work with enron?
what are the international expansion plans and capabilities?
is there any important regulatory summary information we can have?

if this information is not already covered in the review material you sent, 
will you be able recommend other sources where we may find such information?

after we have reviewed the material sent to us recently, we may want to 
schedule a phone call with you and/or one of your colleagues directly 
involved in the retail energy services business.  i would like to call you in 
the new year to discuss this further.  in the meantime, please feel free to 
call me at (215) 546-9416 if you need any information.

regards,
retail energy services tiger team

Please excuse the cancellation due to illness.  The students do not care who
they infect near the end of the semester, they just want to get done!

Here is my available schedule for next year.  I am now overloaded next week
with tasks to complete the semester.  I do hope that we can reschedule
during the first quarter next year.

I would note that my schedule is most free for Thursday or Friday.  I could
fly out late Wednesday night.

Cordially,

Vince and Jeff...the following is ""FYI""...my assistant is working on the 
flight arrangements.  Also, ""FYI"", the DoubleTree and other downtown hotels  
were entirely, or mostly, sold out, but my assistant found a good rate at the 
Warwick [$115] by Herman Park, where everyone will be 'housed' in the same 
location for one night--I also think this location is a good 'Houston-sell'.

Dinner is scheduled for 7 Thursday evening at Churrasco's , and my group is 
arranging the ""TourEnron""--breaking this group into 2.  [FYI: the Energy Club 
from SMU (another Skilling Alma mater) had long ago also schedule a tour that 
day, so we'll have 19 from SMU and 18 from Wharton on the same day...but so 
far, all seems manageable.]

As ""Tour times"" are set, and business unit interview requests are received 
from the students, I'll keep you posted.  
Thanks!

--Christie.

Vince,

I appologize for shipping another version of the paper so soon after the
last.  However, my wife picked me up for some last minute shopping at noon
and I wasn't sure I would get back to this before leaving tomorrow.  The
only changes in the two documents related to a sentence or two in the intro
plus the addition of ""Unused information"" at the end of the document.  The
unused stuff is made up of notes I made from Hamel, some news stories,
press releases, and random thoughts.  We probably won't use any of this
stuff but I wanted you to have it just in case it might prove useful.

The challenge we face at this stage (and where I can most use your help) is
in documenting Enron's risk management functions in a meaningful way.  This
may be best done through examples or in some other way.  I think that our
audience would appreciate our including some numerical and detailed
examples (even if they are to be placed in boxes or sidebars that don't
interrupt the flow of the article.  If you'll make a pass at what you feel
is appropriate I'll gladly polish on the words as i try to learn about what
you are doing myself.

Vince, I really am enjoying this learning experience.  You guys make a
wonderful ""lab"".

Sally and I are driving to Louisiana to pick up her mom tomorrow and then
driving to New Orleans and back to Waco by Saturday.  However, I will check
in my e-mail regularly.

Your friend,

John

Hello everyone,

I wanted to get a message out to each of you to update you on the February
23 conference plans.  The conference promises to provide an exciting
opportunity to share the ideas of a diverse group of academic and industry
professionals on a topic that is dear to all our hearts, the future of
business education in the new economy.  I will be sharing updates and
information with you over the weeks to come but thought it might be useful
to start before the holidays.

I am attaching the most recent ""description of the program of events"" which
remains somewhat fluid as we develop it.  However, there are some new
developments that you will find interesting.  First, I have arranged for
""filming"" of the event by our local public TV station and we will be
working toward the development of the best product possible out of the
sessions.  Second, David Palumbo (Human Code--an internet content
provider-http://www.humancode.com/index2.htm- now owned by Sapient) will
join us.  David is very knowledgable about both educational issues (he
served on the faculty of the University of Houston for 10 years before
joining Human Code).  He has some very interesting insights to offer on the
future of higher education having now worked from the industry side of the
equation).  Finally, I am currently reading a couple of books that you may
find interesting (Telecosm and The New Barbarian Manifesto).  I'm sure
there are many more interesting sources of information that you are each
aware of and it would be helpful if we all began sharing our notes.

Finally, let me suggest that each of you begin thinking about the issue(s)
that you feel most comfortable commenting upon and phrasing ""lead in""
questions for me.  I would like to build a list of such questions to
circulate among all so that we begin to get a feel for the range of topics
we will encounter in the discussion and begin to formulate our individual
opinions.

I hope that this note finds you all anticipating a wonderful holiday season
and thank you for participating in this inaugural ""think tank"" conference
on the future of business education.

Sincerely yours,


John

Here is a short note on potential research with Wharton.  Please review and 
edit and then we can send some indication to the Wharton guys.    ----------

 The objective would be to define the amount of risk an enterprise can take, 
and the difference between this and the actual amount of risk the enterprise 
chooses to take based on the capital structure and reporting structure.  In 
particular, one can view Enron as a hierarchy of companies, and assuming we 
can separately quantify the risks of each unit, what framework would one use 
to analyze risk at Enron? 
  A related question is how one should represent risks in the different 
units?  Risks may be of different types --- short-term volatility risk, 
catastrophic risk, liquidity risk, etc --- what should one focus on for a 
first cut?
 Another related question is to decide on the optimal amount of insurance 
both at the unit level and the enterprise level, and relate the decision to 
get insurance to the cost/benefit of insurance.","here is a short note on potential research with wharton.  please review and

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our ""New Era"" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Best Regards,

Jennifer, 

Thanks for your note!  As these trip details get more formalized, I'll keep 
yopu copied.  For now, know that there are approximately 18 Wharton students 
participating in 3  research projects-- Enron proposed topics-- called the 
""Tiger Program"".  They'll be visiting Enron, arriving Houston Thursday the 
18th, Dinner at Churrasco's (their choice) on the 18th, Enron meetings on the 
19th.

As the details unfold, I'll keep you and Jeff copied.

Thanks!

Frank,

We shall have about 30 people, highly technical (Ph.D.,  M.S. level).
A presentation of 45 minutes would be optimal, assuming you may arrive 
around 11:45 - 12:00.


We shall get the projector for you.

Please, keep all the receipts for refund.

Vince

Excellent, Vince!  Yes, I will be happy to make a presentation.  Do you have a
projector to which I could simply hook up my laptop?  Could we also have an
overhead projector as a backup?  Many thanks, Frank
P.S.  How long is optimal?  How large an audience and what are the
participants' backgrounds?

Dear Vince, Jim, George, David and Vasant:

Neil Doherty, Paul Kleindorfer and I very much enjoyed our discussion last 
Wednesday at Wharton  with you on future joint research  with Enron over the 
coming year. In particular, we see the whole area of capital management and 
catastrophic risk as a fruitful area for foint collaboration. I am sharing 
this message with Louis Thomas and Keith Weigelt who direct the FAP MBA 
program in the hopes that we can find a team to work with us on these issues 
next semester.

Attached is a revised version of our paper on ""Evaluating Risk Bearing, 
Mitigation and Risk Transfer Using Exceedance Probability Curves: Project 
Update"".   We would greatly appreciate you and your colleagues looking at the 
section on ""Cat Bonds Covering Multiple Risks"" (pp. 15-19) to see whether our 
example and conclusions make sense to you. We look forward to working with 
your team at Enron   regarding ways that we can build on these preliminary 
findings to make cat bonds for weather risks  more attractive.

Best wishes for the holiday.

be running our ""New Era"" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Folks:

I have tentatively set the date for our first round-table discussion for 
Wednesday, 
December 20th at 3:00pm-4:30pm.  The room, EB3268, will be available from 
3:00 to 5:00pm.   If any of you have an issue with the date, please let me 
know by 
day's end.

Professor Don Kouri of the Physics Department of the University of Houston 
will start 
with an informal 30-45 minute presentation (see appended abstract below) of 
his work 
and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have.

Professor Kouri, please let me know if you have any requirements for 
audiovisual 
or other equipment.

This excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the 
subject of our meeting:

[...]   topics to
be discussed at a small ``roundtable'' format meeting, are:

1. HDAFs for data analysis, including ``gap-filling'', data
extrapolation, denoising, mathematical manipulations of digital
data (e.g., taking derivatives, applying functions of differential
operators to digital data, etc.)

2. HDAFs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear
partial differential equations, particularly for equations for which
existing methods encounter stability problems.

There are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the
HDAFs but I think that even trying to do both of the above in a
single meeting would be difficult. Of course, in this first meeting
we would focus on general aspects of the HDAFs that make them robust
for such applications. If, however, you have other topics in which
you are interested, I am willing to focus on them.

Folks:

I am trying to set up a meeting with professor Don Kouri of the University of 
Houston and I believe you may have an interest in the topic of discussion.  
If you know of other interested parties, or want to substitute a proxy for 
yourselves, please let me know.

This first meeting with Dr. Kouri will introduce the participants to his area 
of research (HDAFs for data analysis) and allow us to define the contents and 
attendants of a seminar (to come up soon).

We are looking to hold this discussion this week (hopefully) and to have the 
seminar happen before Christmas (given that this is the in-between semester 
season for schools).

A couple of other similar meetings will follow up: Dr Kevin Bassler  will be 
talking about Microscopic Simulation of Economic Markets and Dr. Pinsky about 
the Effect of Solar phenomena on the Earth's atmosphere.

folks:

i am trying to set up a meeting with professor don kouri of the university of 
houston and i believe you may have an interest in the topic of discussion.  
if you know of other interested parties, or want to substitute a proxy for 
yourselves, please let me know.

this first meeting with dr. kouri will introduce the participants to his area 
of research (hdafs for data analysis) and allow us to define the contents and 
attendants of a seminar (to come up soon).

we are looking to hold this discussion this week (hopefully) and to have the 
seminar happen before christmas (given that this is the in-between semester 
season for schools).

a couple of other similar meetings will follow up: dr kevin bassler  will be 
talking about microscopic simulation of economic markets and dr. pinsky about 
the effect of solar phenomena on the earth's atmosphere.

Jim,

Sorry for the delay in responding to your message. I was traveling 
extensively  
and was overwhelmed with many different projects.

I shall be glad to speak at the Gamma Iota Sigma dinner. Unfortunately, I 
cannot make
a presentation to your class (it would require leaving the office for two 
days in a row).

I can, however, promise to come on another day and speak to your students.

I hope everything is going well for you. By the way, your former student, 
Shane Green, has joined us
for 12 month and is doing exceptionally well.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & 
Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John 
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your 
schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as 
our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also 
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate 
students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have in mind is 
a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
classes.? 

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to 
seeing you once again. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

Christie,

Thanks for taking initiative on the trip so quickly. Let's meet with Jeff 
Shankman
to discuss the agenda. I shall try to organize a meeting next week after PRCs
are over.

I agree with your assessment of the group. I was greatly impressed with the 
caliber of the students.

Vince

Hi evryone!

Vince, Vasant and I are very excited about the Tiger Project!  We all 
thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet with such an incredibly 
interesting, enthusiastic and intelligent group.  Thank you for your time!

For those interested in the Houston trip on January 18-19th, please let me 
know by the 15th of December so that I can get the best deal on air fare 
(one-month in advance).

Also, I'll be forwarding the Enron information packages to Donna Piazze for 
your receipt next week.  I am including Jeff Shankman in this reply, as Jeff 
is a Wharton grad, leader of one of our Enron business units, and one of the 
most enthusiastic Enron/Wharton cheerleaders.  

Please feel free to individually contact me if there is anything I can do for 
any of you.

Thanks again for your enthusiastic interest in Enron!

--Christie.

Steve:

 I hope this is not too presumptuous, but I'd like to directly advise you of 
my organization within Corporate HR.

 I am the Senior Director of the Office of Labor and Employment Relations 
(formerly known as the Fair Employment and Labor Practices Group).  I joined 
Enron in February after spending 11 years with MCI WorldCom where I was 
Associate Litigation Counsel in Atlanta representing MCI, and then WorldCom, 
in all of their employment law matters in the Southeast.  Before MCI, I 
practiced labor and employment law with two large law firms, including Vinson 
& Elkins here in Houston.  

 As you will note from the attached org chart, there are seven primary 
functions for which my staff and I am responsible.  In summary fashion, they 
are:

1. Executive Programs (i.e., Impact & Influence, Power of Communication, 
Executive Forums, etc.)

2. Resource Management (i.e, Redeployment, New Hire Orientation)

3. Workforce Development (i.e., diversity efforts such as recruitment, 
training, mentoring, succession planning, etc.)

4. Employee Relations (i.e., EEO charges, internal grievance investigations, 
policy review, advice, etc.)

5. Labor Relations (i.e., union awareness, collective bargaining negotiation, 
M&A advice, etc.)

6. Government Programs (i.e., affirmative action plans, gov't reporting 
requirements, gov't audits, etc.)

7. Employment Law Training (i.e., discrimination, sexual harassment, 
performance management, interviewing skills, etc.  -- all from a risk 
management perspective).

 I hope to be able to spend some time with you filling in the details and 
answering any questions you have.  In the meantime, please let me know if 
there is anything I can provide for you.

In case there is any confusion who is your HR contact following the last 2 days headcount reductions, attached is a updated listing. I anticipate we will make further reductions in HR headcount in line with the wind down of operations but will obviously notify you of these ahead of time.

The Asset team under Stan is not listed attached as it remains largely unchanged.

The people listed attached will be lead by Robert Jones, VP of HR.  Robert, Mary Joyce and myself have set up central specialist HR support teams (not listed attached) based on the 16th floor of the old building to ensure that you and your HR leads have the resources and services they need to provide the necessary HR services for ongoing operations. 

 

Please call Robert, Mary or me with any questions.

Management and employees both have roles in meeting Enron's commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and Harassment Prevention.  To achieve Enron's vision, we need to recruit, select, retain, and manage the most talented people effectively.  We expect all employees to demonstrate Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence in the workplace.  Our efforts to achieve equal employment, and prevent harassment for all employees will guide us towards ensuring that each employee and organization is as productive, inventive, and competitive as possible in a world of changes.

Enron is an equal employment opportunity (EEO) employer.  In choosing to do business with federal, state, and city government agencies, Enron implements affirmative action plans (AAP) to recruit, retain, and promote women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and covered veterans.  Our efforts are inclusive and based on sound business practices, individual qualifications and merit.  Employee and management conduct is expected to be inclusive and equitable in all aspects of the workplace, including recruitment, applicant screening, hiring, training, assignments, compensation, benefits, job performance evaluation, disciplinary action, separation, and the like.  There is no place at Enron for management practices that include bias, favoritism, discrimination, harassment, or conduct that otherwise violates the law or Company policy.

Enron's Harassment Prevention Policy was developed to prevent harassment and help all employees to maintain a productive and mutually rewarding work relationship.  Harassment of any type, including sexual harassment, is contrary to our policy and preventable with education and respectful personal behavior.  We want all employees to know what harassment is, how to prevent it and how to report it.  Our policy outlines these unacceptable behaviors and helps employees better understand work-related expectations and steps.  Every employee at Enron is expected to prevent harassment and report it if it happens.  

Enron's Fair Treatment Policy was developed to provide and maintain a work environment in which all employees are treated equitably.  Our goal is to resolve employment disputes promptly, informally and (where possible) at the lowest level.  Employees who believe they are treated unfairly are encouraged to discuss the matter with their immediate supervisor.  When a concern of unfair, unlawful or unsafe treatment is raised, it will be investigated thoroughly and promptly.  An effective resolution will be reached based on all the information.  The Company will take reasonable steps to ensure confidentiality, but must act on assertions indicating that a violation of policy or law has occurred.

Each of these policies is available for review at http://home.enron.com/resources.  Please familiarize yourself with these policies.  Enron expects and encourages every worker to report workplace issues of concern.  If you need to speak with anyone someone regarding these policies or if an incident occurs that concerns you, please talk with your supervisor, contact your Human Resources representative, or call Enron's Office of Labor and Employment Relations Department at 713-853-7573.  Management is expected to ensure retaliation does not occur.  In addition, Cindy Olson, as  is Enron's EEO officer.  As and  Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Community Relations, Cindy has the responsibility, authority, and full support of Enron to ensure that all employees can avail themselves of our policies.

Your support of respectful workplace relationships adds to a productive and rewarding work environment.  In turn, such personal and organizational success adds to Enron's business success.

Thank you.","

your support of respectful workplace relationships adds to a productive and rewarding work environment.  in turn, such personal and organizational success adds to enron's business success.

Hey gang --
 
I forgot that, after rescheduling three twice due to the events of the past month, Teresa scheduled a meeting for 9:30 this morning with our financial planner.  As a bonus, I'll bring you back his best tips for 401K manipulation in light of our present circumstances!  If I'm needed -- particularly since I sprung this one -- please feel free to call me on my vibrating cellage.  KD -- if I'm needed critically, call.  I can skip if I have to.  I'm getting ready to slam out some more A's for Mary's long list of Q's and hope to focus on that a great deal today.
 
Q: Will Enron senior management lose their bonuses, go to jail, apologize publicly, sit naked in a dunk tank at the next ECafe, donate their life savings to the United Way, and resign immediately?  Also, what happens to Starbucks?
A: Thank you for your thoughtful questions.  On the first one, our review of the situation is underway and no decisions have yet been made, but we welcome your suggestions.  On the second one, beverage service issues will be part of the transition team focus.  ","in case you're wondering...

Fortunately, some of us don't need 50 years to figure most of these things 
out!

                THINGS THAT IT TOOK ME FIFTY YEARS TO LEARN
                                                            (by DAVE BARRY)

1. Never under any circumstances take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the
same night.

2. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not
achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be
""meetings.""

3. There is a very fine line between ""hobby"" and ""mental illness.""

4. People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want
you to share yours with them.

5. And when God, who created the entire universe with all of its glories,
decides to deliver a message to humanity, He WILL NOT use, as His
messenger, a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle.

6. You should not confuse your career with your life.

7. No matter what happens ... somebody will find a way to take it too
seriously.

8. When trouble arises & things look bad, there is always one individual who
perceives a solution & is willing to take command. Very often, that person is
crazy.

9. Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.

10. A person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice person.

11. Never lick a steak knife.

12. Take out the fortune before you eat the cookie.

13. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender,
religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we
ALL believe that we are above average drivers.

14. You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that
you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her
at that moment.

11. never lick a steak knife.

12. take out the fortune before you eat the cookie.

13. the one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender,
religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we
all believe that we are above average drivers.

14. you should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that
you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her
at that moment.

Try this.   It's for real.   The following is the customer
service number for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.

              1-800-578-7453

Dial the number and listen to their greeting message,
until the point when you are requested to choose an
extension, and then you can hang up.
The greeting message is priceless though, and worth the
time it takes to make the toll-free call.","thought you'd get a kick out of this (especially after our recent ""hold

Continuing the current trend of large-scale mergers and acquisitions, it was
announced today at a press conference that Christmas and Chanukah will
merge.  The new mega-holiday will be know as Chrisnuka
>
An industry source said that the deal had been in the works for about 1300
years, ever since the rise of the Muslim Empire.
>
While details were not available at press time, it is believed that the
overhead cost of having twelve days of Christmas and eight days of Chanukah
was becoming prohibitive for both sides. By combining forces, we're  told,
the world will be able to enjoy consistently high-quality service during the
Fifteen Days of Chrisnukah, as the new holiday is being called.  Massive
layoffs are expected, with lords a-leaping and maids a-milking being the
hardest hit. As part of the conditions of the agreement, the letters on the
dreydl, currently in Hebrew, will be replaced by Latin, thus becoming
unintelligible to a wider audience.
>
Also, instead of translating to ""A great miracle happened there,"" the
message on the dreydl will be the more generic ""Miraculous stuff happens.""
In exchange, it is believed that Jews will be allowed to use Santa Claus and
his vast merchandising resources for buying and delivering their gifts.  In
fact, one of the sticking points holding up the agreement for at least three
hundred years was the question of whether Jewish children could leave milk
and cookies for Santa even after having eaten meat for dinner. A
breakthrough came last year, when Oreos were finally declared to be Kosher.
All sides appeared happy about this.
>
A spokesman for Christmas, Inc., declined to say whether a takeover of
Kwanzaa might not be in the works as well.  He merely pointed out that, were
it not for the independent existence of Kwanzaa, the merger between
Christmas and Chanukah might indeed be seen as an unfair cornering of the
holiday market. Fortunately for all concerned, he said, Kwanzaa will help to
maintain the competitive balance.
>
>He then closed the press conference by leading all present in a rousing
rendition of ""Oy, Come All  Ye Faithful.""

","this is why california public policy is so screwed up; they spend their time 
reading and sharing stuff like the attached.  enjoy, anyway!

                 Gov. Davis Plans To Enact Physics Regulations


LOS ANGELES (NAP) - Encouraged by the success of recent legislative efforts to
control the laws of supply and demand for electricity, Gov. Gray Davis 
announced
today the introduction of new changes to the laws of physics.

""We've been suffering too long at the hands of pin-headed scientists and 
engineers
who can't think outside the box,"" Gov. Davis said to an enthusiastic crowd 
outside the
UC Berkeley campus.

Gov. Davis blasted opponents who called the plan to regulate basic physics 
equations
""insane"" and ""impossible."" Responded Gov. Davis, ""Remember the so-called 
economists who said that price controls lead to shortages.  Well, look who's 
laughing now?!""

The new regulatory program is headed by Professor Eugene 'Skippy'Shepperson 
of UC Berkeley, who has been dubbed the Paul Krugman of electrical 
engineering.

""It's really quite astonishing. By fudging a couple coefficients and 
rearranging Ohm's
law, and a couple other mandates, we can double the efficiency of our 
existing power
plants with no environmental side effects. In fact, with no changes to the 
infrastructure at all. It's a real win-win situation,"" Skippy claimed.

The regulatory program consists of legislating a decrease in the resistive 
coefficient of copper and aluminum, commonly used in high tension wires.  ""We 
should be able to considerably cut down on transmission losses with the new 
regulations. The computer models say that we shouldn't lose any electricity 
at all,"" Skippy commented in a speech before Gov. Davis took the podium.

Keys to the program include several changes to the famous R=V/I equation, 
so-called Ohm's Law. Details are still forthcoming, as Skippy's address was 
cut short
when his frantic hand waving injured three bystanders.

""I can't believe we let physics get away with being unregulated for so many 
years,""
declared Jeni Flowerpot of the California NIMBY Coalition. ""We have some 
serious gripes with chemistry and biology, as well. If we can tinker with 
economics and physics, why the wait to get true pollution control and sexual 
equality?"" asked the CNIABEC representative.

The new regulatory program would set an interesting precedent in the state 
that has
given birth to many innovative legislative efforts.  ""If this program is 
successful, we have plans to investigate the Second Law of Thermodynamics for 
antitrust violations,"" Gov. Davis continued to rousing applause.

""Getting something for nothing is every Californian's right!"" 

Leading scientists in universities not located in California were skeptical, 
however.
""I want some of what Skippy's been smoking,"" stated Professor Sara Powell of 
Duke
University in North Carolina. ""You can't change the laws of nature when you 
don't
like the results. Physics isn't Calvinball.""

Gov. Davis and his supporters were not swayed in their support for Skippy and 
his
new ideas in the field of electrical engineering.

""If this program does fail, we'll have only the greedy out of state electric 
companies to blame. Everybody knows that they rake in excessive profits when
they don't sell electricity,"" Gov. Davis replied.","4/1/01

Check out the end of the burrito.



THE FRIDAY BURRITO

Ben Zycher from the RAND Corporation used the following line in his talk at
the WPTF General Meeting in Phoenix a few weeks ago. The story takes place
in the good ol' days of the Soviet Union when Brezhnev was Premier.
Brezhnev and the rest of the Politburo one fine May Day were watching the
tanks and missiles pass by the Kremlin Wall, when Leonid noticed in the
middle of the parade a truck carrying a group of civilians.=01; He turned t=
o
Dmitri Ustinov, the Defense Minister, and asked, ""Who are they?""=01; Ustino=
v
replied, ""Those are our economists.=01; You just wouldn't believe their
destructive potential.""

This is appropriate for our time and our situation.=01; The economists
descended upon us when the California market was designed, but we know not
from where.=01; Aliens?=01; Since weaving conspiracy theories is a popular =
past
time in Sacramento (""We just know they are gouging us, them bullies""), I
believe that one must do the same by following the money.=01; I'm not talki=
ng
about the campaign contributions in Gray Davis' pocket. The most money has
gone from power sales in California to the Canadian Province of British
Columbia.=01; It was a plot the Canadians hatched. I mean, look at Governor
Davis.=01; He looks kind of BC-ish.=01; Skinny and lanky, wimpy hair, and a
hesitation in his speech. He talks their language: a mix of misspelled
French (""meet me at the centre""), English, and Eh(?).=01; One night in 1996=
,
the BC government secretly sent us some economists by the truckload to
destroy California.=01; The utilities probably paid for the bus tickets.=01=
; I
happen to know that Frank Wolak, Chair of the ISO Market Surveillance
Committee once lectured at a University in Vancouver, B.C..=01; What more
evidence do you need?=01; The BC Government sent us cheap hydro power, sold=
 at
inflated market prices so that they could do what the citizens of
California wanted to do with their budget largess ? build roads, schools,
and hospitals. They didn't think we could figure out their plot, but we
did.=01; Now is the time for California to counter-attack.=01; We'll send t=
hem
some of our politicians, a bipartisan group including a few who can add,
and some of our select energy thugs from the CPUC and the Blind Oversight
Board.

Speaking of times and situations, there was a time when discussing the ISO,
words such as ""communist"" and ""Nazi"" were only uttered, by my pal, Carl
Imparato,.=01; We would shake our heads, and chuckle at Carl's extremism.=
=01; We
aren't laughing now.=01; The descriptors seem to arise again and again in
polite conversation by a wider circle of people.=01; I watch with utter
amusement (because the alternative is retching breakfast) at the
demagoguery of the ISO Governing Board, the Market Despair Team, the
Governor's office, and some members of the California Legislature. Like an
audience watching a tragedy from hell, we scream aloud, ""These people are
crazy!""=01; And indeed, they are.=01; Mr. President is not helping us at al=
l by
continuing to wrangle over who gets the musical Chair at FERC ? Bubba Curt
or Bubba Patrick.=01; Listen to us, Mr. President.=01; Let Bubba Curt keep =
the
reigns for a year or two, and let Bubba Patrick take a seat at the table.
We need someone with a shockproof BS detector.=01; Someone who can honestly
field a motion to dismiss the California ISO.=01; The time is long overdue =
to
shoot this horse in the head.

Not all is evil.=01; This week in Houston, the resource capital of Californ=
ia,
I visited the trading floor folks at Dynegy, before attending the WTPF
Board meeting.=01; The coolest thing I saw, besides all the neat gadgets on
each trader's desk, was the coffee machine.=01; Brother Jolly Hayden showed=
 me
how to use it.=01; You pick the type of coffee you want.=01; The contents o=
f the
coffee are in a shot-glass sized plastic tub with a foil top.=01; I picked
Venezuelan #6 Decaffeinated Waxy Crude.=01; The tub is placed inside the
brewing machine, and the start button is pushed.=01; Presto, coffee drips f=
rom
the spout into a waiting cup.=01; I asked Jolly, ""How did the hot water get
mixed into the ground beans?""=01; He removed the tub from the machine and
showed me a pin prick hole made in the foil top, and another that was made
at the bottom.=01; Is that neat, or what?

I would like to buy a brewing machine just like the Dynegy coffee machine,
but a little larger.=01; I would set up a booth in Sacramento, on the corne=
r
of 11th and ""L"", and bark out to passing members of the Legislature, ""Free
space shuttle. Come and see life on other planets.""=01; They would jump at =
the
chance to visit other planets.=01; I would seat them in the machine, push t=
he
start button, and voila.=01; Dripping out would be the essence of democracy=
.
Don't worry about the holes needed at the top and the bottom.=01; They are
already there, and quite enlarged.

Back to my day at Dynegy.=01; Trade floors might seem similar across
companies, but the small differences speak to the management style embraced
by the crew and its leaders.=01; Each electric trading desk, for various pa=
rts
of the country, is set up a little bit differently.=01; For example, some
desks have a person doing asset-backed trading, but some don't.=01; When I
arrived at 6 a.m., Houston time, the Eastern desk was busy in its trade
day.=01; The Western folks hadn't arrived, yet.=01; Later, I sat with Randy
LeForce of the Western desk.=01; ""Captain LeForce, to you"", he told me.=01;=
 He
could talk big because Dave Francis, who sits next to Randy, and hangs
witty quotes from the ceiling above his head (""Even a blind pig could make
money in this market""), was on vacation.=01; As the pace of the trading
gathered steam, Randy kept an eye on all the different people working the
Western trading desk.=01; The Captain worked it like a maestro.

During my visit, some Dynegy folks came up to me, introduced themselves,
and said how much they enjoyed the Friday Burrito.=01; I'll tell you what.
There are few things in life that give me as much satisfaction.=01; Complet=
e
strangers who tell you that something you do makes them feel good, well, it
doesn't get any better than that.=01; Garrison Keillor, the well-known auth=
or
of Lake Woebegone Days, and NPR radio entertainer once said a writer should
have an audience.=01; Not everyone in the world should be in the audience, =
but
an audience nonetheless of some people.=01; I now know what he means.=01; A=
nd the
people I met on the trading floor felt like they knew me, and shared with
me their thoughts and opinions on a lot of things.=01;=01; Often they asked=
 me,
""Are those California people really that crazy?""

Since last week, you might have noticed the pace at the FERC has picked up,
somewhat.=01; Last Friday the FERC issued an Order on possible refunds for
alleged overcharges by parties selling to the ISO last January.=01; That wa=
s
news worthy.=01; Then, on Wednesday, the FERC issued an Order to remove
barriers to additional electric generation in the West.=01; The Order admit=
s
that it won't change the dire situation in the West, but these are steps in
the right direction.=01; The FERC also issued on Wednesday a show-cause ord=
er
to AES and Williams regarding the maintenance of RMR units that were called
by the ISO in April and May of 2000.=01; That is a serious case that we mus=
t
watch closely.=01; Also this week, the California Senate kicked off its own
investigation (this will be the tenth such investigation of the California
markets to uncover alleged price manipulation).=01; The Senate Committee wi=
ll
have subpoena rights, and if I understand it correctly, they plan to
subpoena individuals.=01; Sounds like a Kangaroo Court and a Three-Ring
Circus, to me. Thursday, Secretary Abraham stated in a congressional
hearing that the West would certainly experience power outages this summer.
Finally, an LA Times reporter asked me if I had heard that a small QF
company had filed for seizure of SCE property to satisfy an outstanding
debt.=01; That would be step one of the bankruptcy cha-cha.=01; All in all,=
 a
typical week among crazy people.

Let's see what else we can talk about.

Things in the People's Republic of California
=01;@@@ PUC Updates Utility Liabilities

My favorite regulator, the California PUC, issued an Order in the
Utilities' Rate Stabilization case to re-open the record on utility audits.
Although the text of the order is unremarkable, the data tables bring up to
date, as of March 8, the outstanding liabilities of PG&E and SCE.

The PG&E commercial paper obligation due as of March 8 increased by $354
million since January 31, for a total default amount of $790 million.=01; Q=
F
purchases increased by $280 million for the same five-week period, now
totaling $651 million.=01; The ISO payments increased $934 million, now
totaling $1.5 billion, and the direct access charge backs for negative PX
credits increased $214 million, now totaling $433 million.=01; PG&E's total
default amount is now $3.3 billion excluding amounts yet to be collected
from PG&E customers for DWR purchases.

The SCE balance is as follows: The commercial paper obligation that is due
as of March 8 increased by $260 million since January 31, for a total
default amount of $401 million. SCE defaulted on a significant amount of
long-term debt principal and interest, roughly $249 million.=01; QF purchas=
e
defaults increased by $354 million for the same five-week period, now
totaling $835 million.=01; The ISO obligations decreased $1.1 million, and =
the
direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased $21 million,
now totaling $25 million.=01; SCE's total default amount is now $1.7 billio=
n
excluding amounts yet to be collected from SCE customers for DWR purchases.

There is little question that the QFs are taking it on the chin, big time.
In the last five weeks, between January 31 and March 8, the defaulted
payments to the QF owners from both utilities has increased $630 million.
The total QF default for both utilities as of March 8 stands at $1.5
billion.=01; Does anyone wonder why 1500 MW of QF capacity has shut down in
California?=01; Without these payments being made very soon, I would expect
the amount of shut down QF capacity to easily double, or more.=01; Why woul=
d
these projects produce without the promise of being paid?

Things in the People's Republic of California
=01;@@@ Be a Source for Energy Price Update

Art O'Donnell, editor and associate publisher of the well-known and widely
read California Energy Market (CEM), is looking for traders willing to
participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copy.=01; T=
he
Survey is a regular feature in CEM. The information collected by Art is
matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some
posted sources (Pricewaterhouse Coopers; BPA's daily offerings, for
instance).=01; It is written up in narrative form. The report goes out twic=
e
weekly, once on Wednesday afternoon/evening via e-mail as a courtesy to the
respondents (because the week is pretty much done by then), and a rewrite
on Friday that is e-mailed around 10 am, posted on the newsdata.com Web
site, and published in the newsletter for general consumption. The Friday
report also features a brief story about natural gas markets in the West

The WPTF Board of Directors has allowed me to publicize this offering, and
to explain that if your company is interested in participating, the
information you provide to Art would be protected as confidential.=01; In
Art's words, ""The price survey is ? unlike some attempts at creating a
tradable index number (e.g. McGraw-Hill's Power Markets Week index or the
Dow Jones indices), is more of a narrative about the state of the market d
a pulse reading as opposed to a blood pressure number or an EKG. As such, I
do not ask traders and schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes
associated with specific trades, but rather questions like, 'What's
Mid-Columbia going for today? What about off-peak? How has that changed
since this morning? Oh yeah, why is that? Anything else I should know?'""

The WPTF Board asked Art to explain how the information he collects would
be protected since so many marketers and generators are under State data
subpoenas.=01; Art replied, ""The Constitution of the State of California
provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news
gathering from confidential sources and unpublished information, something
which we believe in strongly at Energy NewsData Corporation and which we
are willing to go to jail to protect. So if, for instance, the Attorney
General tried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price
information, we would 1) refuse to divulge anything other than the already
published accounts, 2) send back a copy of the Constitution, 3) contact the
attorneys for the Society of Professional Journalists, and 4) start
preparing a benefit party to raise legal fees. ""

If you would like to participate in Art's survey, please e-mail him at
aod@newsdata.com.

Things in the People's Republic of California
=01;@@@ BPA Misquoted in the WSJ

In last week's Burrito, I referred to a Wall Street Journal article that
portrayed a BPA trader as admonishing the DWR for accepting bids over
market prices.=01; I was surprised when I received the following e-mail fro=
m
BPA's David Mills.=01; His message to me copied a letter he sent to DWR's R=
ay
Hart, explaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying.

Dear Ray:

As per our telephone discussion, I just wanted to reiterate a few things
re:the Wall Street Journal article and the quotes attributed to me.=01; At =
no
time during the interview with Ms Smith did I state that I thought that
CDWR's offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in
California or that your traders should check that price before entering the
market.=01; The reporter was quite interested in the price difference betwe=
en
California and the MidC price here in the Northwest and when I asked I told
her that currently that price delta was roughly $50-$100 MWhr, with MidC
being lower than the CA prices.=01; I did not indicate to the reporter that=
 I
thought that CDWR was paying more than the California market price and was
simply trying to make a comparison of price relativity between California
and the Northwest.=01; Lastly, BPA has, on occasion, charged extra-regional
entities less than the prevailing market price but has only done so to
remain consistent with our own pricing strategies.

=01;I apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have
resulted from this and look forward to a continuing working relationship
between CDWR and BPA.

Things FERC
=01;@@@ Market Monitoring Proposal

FERC Staff issued a report with ""Recommendations on Prospective Market
Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power
Market.""=01; WPTF members are taking this proposal very seriously, and we
intend to provide comments on March 22.=01; If you are interested in a copy=
 of
the report, go to http://www3.ferc.fed.us/bulkpower/bulkpower.htm.

General members are able to participate along with the Board members and
other general members working on our response.=01; We have retained the
services of Dr. Ben Zycher of the RAND Corporation to help us draft the
policy issues.=01; He will be working with our counsel, Dan Douglass of Art=
er
& Hadden to craft our reply.

In short, our submission will point out the flaws in FERC's proposed
methodology, and demonstrate the shortcomings of narrowly limiting the
definition of producer marginal cost to operating variable cost.=01; Furthe=
r,
excluding measures of credit worthiness are an important missing variable
in the FERC analysis.=01; Next week, I will include a short summary of our
response in the Burrito.

Letters

I received a note from one of our legal beagles that drop me a line every
now and then.=01; I don't have the facts of the case to which this person
refers, but I hope the sender provides us with an update if a judgement
should occur. ""Universal Studios wants FERC to find that Universal owes no
penalty to SCE for not interrupting its interruptible load (under a CPUC
rate schedule) because SCE did not adhere to the FERC requirement in the
Dec 15 order to schedule 95% of its load in the day ahead market ......
according to Universal, if SCE had done so, then it would have had to
provide Universal power at below its cost.=01; SCE didn't and Universal; go=
t
interrupted and now Universal owes $$$$$$$$$$$$$.""=01; Does anyone else kno=
w
about this filing?

Lind Guerry, veteran of the PX halcyon days, wrote, ""Hi Gary.=01; Hope you'=
re
having a nice day.=01; Just wanted to let you know that I'm really enjoying
the Burrito, and am so glad you're sending it to my home email.=01; I reall=
y
got a kick out of the ""Ten Reasons....""=01; It's hard to believe that our
wonderful state is in such incompetent hands, isn't it?=01; And not only ar=
e
they incompetent, they continue to remain so, with such regularity, you
could probably make a killing marketing their incompetence as a laxative.
Do you think if we tried to do that, we'd get accused of exercising market
power? Think of the power we'd wield, as the holder of the largest amount
of incompetence!! ""

Lind, we need a product name for the laxative idea.=01; Any ideas? How abou=
t
Sane Away?

Jobs and People

The folks at Dynegy sent me a couple of job postings.=01; If your company h=
as
similar posting or job openings, or if you are reader looking for a new
gig, drop me a line.=01; After all, it's free.

Position Description:

Dynegy's position has responsibility for the development of transmission
and power markets in a geographic region of the U.S.=01; Duties are driven
primarily by federal, regional, and state activities to restructure and
deregulate the electric power industry, and the need for industry
participants to develop and implement market structures, policies, and
regulations that promote liquid and competitive transmission and power
markets.=01; Significant activity within a region to reshape the structure =
and
operation of the transmission grid is resulting from FERC Order 2000, which
directs the establishment of Regional Transmission Organizations. Extensive
travel (40%-60%, and higher at times) is highly probable. Primary goals of
this position are to:1) Create more liquid and competitive transmission and
power markets;=01; 2) Maximize the value of Dynegy's positions and assets b=
y
working closely with the trading and power groups to develop=01;=01; and
implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant
business opportunities; and 3) Provide timely and accurate information,
market intelligence, and recommendations to clients. 4) Maximize the value
of Dynegy's positions and assets by working closely with the trading and
power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and
capture significant business opportunities; and recommendations to clients.

Interested parties should contact Jolly Hayden at jjha@ngccorp.com.

Odds & Ends (_!_)

First, I would like to welcome WPTF's newest general member, Wellhead
Electric.=01; Hal Dittmer is the founder and president of Wellhead.=01; I h=
ave
known Hal for a couple of years, first as a client for my over priced
consulting services, and later as a friend and source of all kinds of
useful information.=01; Wellhead is one of those QF owners who are owed a
boatload of money.=01; However, Hal's company is developing some new projec=
ts,
and he is looking for prospective power buyers.=01; Hence, his interest in
WPTF is obvious. Wellhead is WPTF's 31st member.

Well, the Dynegy gang has been a source of comfort and joy to me this week.
They couldn't let me leave their abode without stuffing a song in my pocket
that is a tribute to their creative skills.=01; Timely too.=01; Sing it to =
the
tune of ""California Dreaming"", by the Mamas and the Papas.

                              ISO California
                     (to the tune of Hotel California)


On a dark Western highway
No wind in my hair
No rain for the hydro
No NOX in the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a flickering sight
The load grew heavy and the lights grew dim
No relief in the night
So we stood in the darkness
Down at the Taco Bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
We lit up a candle
No power in the Bay
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say=01; ?

Welcome to the ISO California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Powering up for the ISO California
What a nice surprise
What a nice surprise
Bring your alibis=01; ?

Its mind is policy twisted
Can't stop consumption trends
Got a lot of NIMBY boys
Cisco calls friends
How we sweat in the courthouse
Sweet summer sweat
Without the AC
We try to forget
So I called up the Gov'nor
Please energize this line
He said
We haven't built a new plant here since 1969
Last thing I remember
We were running for the door
We had to find the passage back to the place we were before
Relax said Judge Damrell
California's programmed to receive
Go belly up any time you like
But your power can never leave

back to my day at dynegy.=01; trade floors might seem similar across
companies, but the small differences speak to the management style embraced
by the crew and its leaders.=01; each electric trading desk, for various pa=
rts
of the country, is set up a little bit differently.=01; for example, some
desks have a person doing asset-backed trading, but some don't.=01; when i
arrived at 6 a.m., houston time, the eastern desk was busy in its trade
day.=01; the western folks hadn't arrived, yet.=01; later, i sat with randy
leforce of the western desk.=01; ""captain leforce, to you"", he told me.=01;=
 he
could talk big because dave francis, who sits next to randy, and hangs
witty quotes from the ceiling above his head (""even a blind pig could make
money in this market""), was on vacation.=01; as the pace of the trading
gathered steam, randy kept an eye on all the different people working the

things in the people's republic of california
=01;@@@ puc updates utility liabilities

my favorite regulator, the california puc, issued an order in the
utilities' rate stabilization case to re-open the record on utility audits.
although the text of the order is unremarkable, the data tables bring up to
date, as of march 8, the outstanding liabilities of pg&e and sce.

the pg&e commercial paper obligation due as of march 8 increased by $354
million since january 31, for a total default amount of $790 million.=01; q=
f
purchases increased by $280 million for the same five-week period, now
totaling $651 million.=01; the iso payments increased $934 million, now
totaling $1.5 billion, and the direct access charge backs for negative px
credits increased $214 million, now totaling $433 million.=01; pg&e's total
default amount is now $3.3 billion excluding amounts yet to be collected
from pg&e customers for dwr purchases.

the sce balance is as follows: the commercial paper obligation that is due
as of march 8 increased by $260 million since january 31, for a total
default amount of $401 million. sce defaulted on a significant amount of
long-term debt principal and interest, roughly $249 million.=01; qf purchas=
e
defaults increased by $354 million for the same five-week period, now
totaling $835 million.=01; the iso obligations decreased $1.1 million, and =
the
direct access charge backs for negative px credits increased $21 million,
now totaling $25 million.=01; sce's total default amount is now $1.7 billio=
n
excluding amounts yet to be collected from sce customers for dwr purchases.

there is little question that the qfs are taking it on the chin, big time.
in the last five weeks, between january 31 and march 8, the defaulted
payments to the qf owners from both utilities has increased $630 million.
the total qf default for both utilities as of march 8 stands at $1.5
billion.=01; does anyone wonder why 1500 mw of qf capacity has shut down in
california?=01; without these payments being made very soon, i would expect
the amount of shut down qf capacity to easily double, or more.=01; why woul=
d
these projects produce without the promise of being paid?

things in the people's republic of california
=01;@@@ be a source for energy price update

art o'donnell, editor and associate publisher of the well-known and widely
read california energy market (cem), is looking for traders willing to
participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copy.=01; t=
he
survey is a regular feature in cem. the information collected by art is
matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some
posted sources (pricewaterhouse coopers; bpa's daily offerings, for
instance).=01; it is written up in narrative form. the report goes out twic=
e
weekly, once on wednesday afternoon/evening via e-mail as a courtesy to the
respondents (because the week is pretty much done by then), and a rewrite
on friday that is e-mailed around 10 am, posted on the newsdata.com web
site, and published in the newsletter for general consumption. the friday
report also features a brief story about natural gas markets in the west

the wptf board of directors has allowed me to publicize this offering, and
to explain that if your company is interested in participating, the
information you provide to art would be protected as confidential.=01; in
art's words, ""the price survey is ? unlike some attempts at creating a
tradable index number (e.g. mcgraw-hill's power markets week index or the
dow jones indices), is more of a narrative about the state of the market d
a pulse reading as opposed to a blood pressure number or an ekg. as such, i
do not ask traders and schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes
associated with specific trades, but rather questions like, 'what's
mid-columbia going for today? what about off-peak? how has that changed
since this morning? oh yeah, why is that? anything else i should know?'""

the wptf board asked art to explain how the information he collects would
be protected since so many marketers and generators are under state data
subpoenas.=01; art replied, ""the constitution of the state of california
provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news
gathering from confidential sources and unpublished information, something
which we believe in strongly at energy newsdata corporation and which we
are willing to go to jail to protect. so if, for instance, the attorney
general tried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price
information, we would 1) refuse to divulge anything other than the already
published accounts, 2) send back a copy of the constitution, 3) contact the
attorneys for the society of professional journalists, and 4) start
preparing a benefit party to raise legal fees. ""

if you would like to participate in art's survey, please e-mail him at
aod@newsdata.com.

things in the people's republic of california
=01;@@@ bpa misquoted in the wsj

in last week's burrito, i referred to a wall street journal article that
portrayed a bpa trader as admonishing the dwr for accepting bids over
market prices.=01; i was surprised when i received the following e-mail fro=
m
bpa's david mills.=01; his message to me copied a letter he sent to dwr's r=
ay
hart, explaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying.

dear ray:

as per our telephone discussion, i just wanted to reiterate a few things
re:the wall street journal article and the quotes attributed to me.=01; at =
no
time during the interview with ms smith did i state that i thought that
cdwr's offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in
california or that your traders should check that price before entering the
market.=01; the reporter was quite interested in the price difference betwe=
en
california and the midc price here in the northwest and when i asked i told
her that currently that price delta was roughly $50-$100 mwhr, with midc
being lower than the ca prices.=01; i did not indicate to the reporter that=
 i
thought that cdwr was paying more than the california market price and was
simply trying to make a comparison of price relativity between california
and the northwest.=01; lastly, bpa has, on occasion, charged extra-regional
entities less than the prevailing market price but has only done so to
remain consistent with our own pricing strategies.

=01;i apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have
resulted from this and look forward to a continuing working relationship
between cdwr and bpa.

things ferc
=01;@@@ market monitoring proposal

ferc staff issued a report with ""recommendations on prospective market
monitoring and mitigation for the california wholesale electric power
market.""=01; wptf members are taking this proposal very seriously, and we
intend to provide comments on march 22.=01; if you are interested in a copy=
 of
the report, go to http://www3.ferc.fed.us/bulkpower/bulkpower.htm.

general members are able to participate along with the board members and
other general members working on our response.=01; we have retained the
services of dr. ben zycher of the rand corporation to help us draft the
policy issues.=01; he will be working with our counsel, dan douglass of art=
er
& hadden to craft our reply.

in short, our submission will point out the flaws in ferc's proposed
methodology, and demonstrate the shortcomings of narrowly limiting the
definition of producer marginal cost to operating variable cost.=01; furthe=
r,
excluding measures of credit worthiness are an important missing variable
in the ferc analysis.=01; next week, i will include a short summary of our
response in the burrito.

letters

i received a note from one of our legal beagles that drop me a line every
now and then.=01; i don't have the facts of the case to which this person
refers, but i hope the sender provides us with an update if a judgement
should occur. ""universal studios wants ferc to find that universal owes no
penalty to sce for not interrupting its interruptible load (under a cpuc
rate schedule) because sce did not adhere to the ferc requirement in the

position description:

dynegy's position has responsibility for the development of transmission
and power markets in a geographic region of the u.s.=01; duties are driven
primarily by federal, regional, and state activities to restructure and
deregulate the electric power industry, and the need for industry
participants to develop and implement market structures, policies, and
regulations that promote liquid and competitive transmission and power
markets.=01; significant activity within a region to reshape the structure =
and
operation of the transmission grid is resulting from ferc order 2000, which
directs the establishment of regional transmission organizations. extensive
travel (40%-60%, and higher at times) is highly probable. primary goals of
this position are to:1) create more liquid and competitive transmission and
power markets;=01; 2) maximize the value of dynegy's positions and assets b=
y
working closely with the trading and power groups to develop=01;=01; and
implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant
business opportunities; and 3) provide timely and accurate information,
market intelligence, and recommendations to clients. 4) maximize the value
of dynegy's positions and assets by working closely with the trading and
power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and
capture significant business opportunities; and recommendations to clients.

Call me a ""softie,"" but I couldn't help passing this one on.  Have a great 
weekend! SRS :-)


First Important Lesson - Everyone's job is important

During my second month of nursing school, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I 
was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions, until I 
read the last one:

""What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?""

Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several 
times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50's, but how would I know her 
name? I left the question blank.

Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count 
toward our quiz grade. ""Absolutely,"" said the professor. ""In your careers, 
you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention 
and care, even if all you do is smile and say 'hello'.""

""I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.


Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain

One night, at 11:30 PM, an older African American woman was standing on the 
side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had 
broken down and she desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to 
flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her, generally 
unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s.

The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi 
cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry, but   wrote down his address and 
thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door. To his 
surprise, a giant  onsole color TV was delivered to his home.

A special note was attached. It read: ""Thank you so much for assisting me on 
the highway the other night. The rain  drenched not only my clothes, but also 
my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make it to my 
dying husband's bedside just before he passed away. God bless you for helping 
me and unselfishly serving others."" Sincerely, Mrs. Nat King Cole.

Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve.

In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy 
entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of 
water in front of him. ""How much is an ice cream sundae?"" he asked.

""Fifty cents,"" replied the waitress.

The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it. 
""Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?"" he inquired.

By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing 
impatient. ""Thirty-five cents,"" she brusquely  replied.""

The little boy again counted his coins. ""I'll have the plain ice cream,"" he 
said. The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and 
walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left.

When the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. 
There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies 
-- You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left 
to leave her a tip.

Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path

In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid 
himself and watched to see if anyone would  remove the huge rock.  

Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply 
walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads 
clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way. 

Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the 
boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the 
side of the road. 

After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant 
picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed  a purse lying in the road where 
the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins ad a note from the 
king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from 
the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand: 

Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.

Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts 

Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a 
little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her 
only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year 
old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed 
the antibodies needed to combat the illness.

The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the 
little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. 

I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, 
""Yes, I'll do it if it will save her.""

As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, 
as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew 
pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a 
trembling  voice, ""Will I start to die right away?""

Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was 
going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.

You see, after all, understanding and attitude, are everything.","call me a ""softie,"" but i couldn't help passing this one on.  have a great

George Bush and Dick Cheney are enjoying a celebration dinner at a fancy

She asks Cheney what he wants, and he replies,   ""I'll have the heart-healthy

Bush answers, ""How about a quickie?""

The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite 

By DAVE BARRY  

When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California, our  
reaction, as concerned Americans, is: Ha ha!  

No, seriously, we are alarmed. Because history teaches us that whatever  
happens to California -- smog, road rage, tofu, coffee that is mainly air, 
cell  phones, the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive, Shirley 
MacLaine,  people taking in-line skating seriously, grandmothers sporting new 
and  flagrantly inappropriate bosoms -- eventually happens to the rest of the 
nation.  Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage 
and see if  we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and 
change the  subject.  

Our first question is: What, exactly, is electricity? When we look in our  
Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia, we see that ""electricity"" is defined  as a 
""class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge  and from 
the interaction of charges."" What does this mean, in lay-person's  terms?  

It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big, fat  
dope. Because we know from our junior-high-school science training that  
electricity is actually a fast-moving herd of electrons, which are tiny  
one-celled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside 
a  double-A battery, where they die within minutes.  

Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited. This was  
proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during 
a  thunderstorm and was almost killed. Encouraged by this success, Franklin 
went on  to conduct many more electrical experiments, including rolling a 
hoop in a  thunderstorm, playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing 
somersaults in a  thunderstorm.  

Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister  
Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm, leaving the authorities with no 
choice  but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France.  Nevertheless, 
Franklin had proved an important scientific point, which is  that electricity 
originates inside clouds. There it forms into lightning, which  is attracted 
to the earth by golfers.  

After entering the ground, the electricity hardens into coal, which, when 
dug  up by power companies and burned in big ovens called ""generators,""  
turns back into electricity, which is sent in the form of ""volts""  (also 
known as ""watts,"" or ""rpm"" for short) through special  wires with birds 
sitting on them to consumers' homes, where it is transformed by  TV sets into 
commercials for beer, which passes through the consumers and back  into the 
ground, thus completing what is known as a ""circuit.""  

But enough technical talk. The problem is that California is running out of  
electricity. The situation is so bad that in some hospitals, they don't have  
enough electricity to power those electric-shock paddles that get people's  
hearts started again; instead, the doctors and nurses have to hold hands, 
scuff  their feet across the carpet in unison, then shout ""CLEAR!"" as they  
touch the patient's chest.  

Who is responsible for California's electricity shortage? You could blame 
the  power companies; or you could blame environmental wackos; or you could 
blame the  entertainment industry, which uses more than 750 billion watts of 
electricity  per day just to blow-dry the hair of the cast of Dawson's Creek; 
or you  could blame (why not?) the Firestone tire company. But you would be 
wrong.  Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity 
shortage is:  college students.  

I base this statement on widespread observation of my son, who is a college  
student, and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium. If my son 
is  in a room, then every electrical device within 200 yards of that room -- 
every  light, computer, television, stereo, video game, microwave oven, etc. 
-- will be  running. My son doesn't even have to turn the devices on; they 
activate  themselves spontaneously in response to his presence.  

Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in  
California, which according to my research is (EDITOR: Please insert number 
of  college students in California) and you see my point, which is (EDITOR: 
Please  insert my point).  

The question is: What can the rest of us do to help our fellow 
countrypersons  in California? The answer is that we can send them our spare 
electricity. Just  imagine what would happen if all the households in this 
great and generous  nation got out their extension cords and connected them 
together, forming a  giant electrical ""chain of helping"" across the fruited 
plain to the  Golden State! Millions of people would be turned into generous 
smoking lumps of  carbon, that's what. So maybe we should go with Plan B. 
This involves building a  really, really, really big kite.

Touche'

The Wisdom of Will Rogers

Don't squat with your spurs on.

Good  judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad  
judgment.

Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin'  it back in.

If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every  now and then to 
make sure it's still there.

If you get to thinkin' you're  a person of some influence, try orderin' 
somebody else's dog  around.

After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he  started 
roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him... The  moral: 
When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.

Never kick a cow  chip on a hot day.

There's two theories to arguin' with a woman. Neither  one works.

If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop  diggin'.

Never slap a man who's chewin' tobacco.

It don't take a  genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep.

Always drink upstream from the  herd.

When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't  be 
surprised if they learn their lesson.

When you're throwin' your weight  around, be ready to have it thrown around 
by somebody else.

The quickest  way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in 
your  pocket.

Never miss a good chance to shut up.

There are three kinds  of men. The one that learns by reading. The few who 
learn by observation. The  rest of them have to pee on the electric fence 
for  themselves.

If you were wondering why Hebert, speaking at the meeting  said that he would 
certainly be viewed as a Grinch, here is a transcript of a poem read on NPR 
last week.  It is meant to be read with the same timing as Dr. Suess's 
Grinch.  Thanks to Leslie Comnes (a California ratepayer whom I hold in high 
regard) for transcribing:

The Whos and Who's Whos in the great Golden State
Love the Christmas light season, the lights are first rate.
They glitter, they sparkle all red, white, and blue-ish,
They impress even Whos who are ACLUish.
They dazzle the neighborhoods hour by hour,
'til someone says, ""Shut them off! We're out of power.""
Just who is the source of this Christmas light pinch?
Does the great Golden State have its very own Grinch?
Does the smog belching, grease guzzling junk TV creep
Take lights out of Christmas, so children will weep?
We'll catch and declaw him, it sounds rather simple,
Yet much more complex than a Florida dimple.
We'll trap him by leaving a late evening snack out,
Not that he'll see it at night in a blackout.
The Whos grasp at straws, ""There's one man who can save us,""
And they hang their Who hopes on their governor, Davis.
""He'll light the state tree, and he'll keep it ablaze, 
and the white fir will glow for the next 30 days!""
The Gov lights the tree, and he says with a scoff,
""30 days? 30 minutes! Now turn that thing off!""
But Davis a Grinch? That would be quite a climb,
His gig's raising money, it takes all his time.
""Who, then?"" demand all the Whos and Who's Whos.
""Who cut the juice? Tell us now, we need clues!""
Well, now some blame the cold in the arctic Northwest, 
But others say that power plants close for a rest.
Some say it's FERC, yet don't know what FERC means,
But they think that some FERC jerk messed with power machines.
Some blame El Nino, and some cite Cal-ISO [?],
But no one will rule out H. Ross Perot.
The blackouts are rolling out Stage 1, 2, and 3.
They're saying, ""Cut power, de-sparkle your tree!""
Men walk on the moon and invent penicillin, 
So wouldn't you think they could find us a villain?
The Whos and Who's Whos in the great Golden State
See Christmas light evenings start two hours late.
Is it too much to ask, just one culprit to lynch? 
It's just so unfair that we can't find a Grinch!

On another note, I will be send the photos + negatives via FEDEX today to

Louise,

Carlos has informed me that he has been told he will likely be laid off. 

You may wish to consider intervening to keep him:

- If the new purchaser is interested in the TexMex concept, Carlos is the most important Mexican link. He has great relationships, has negotiated MOU's and is close to contract with multiple customers.

- If we desire to retain EnronOnline expertise, Carlos has it.

- He is still on the US payroll and has an Enron working visa.

Attached is a detailed report on the status on completed performance reviews across EWS (excluding EEL - who had 95% of their completed by 7/31). In brief, here are the headlines:

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES					
 					
	Enron Americas	1078	432	40.1%	
	Enron Broadband Services, Inc	822	180	21.9%	
	Enron Canada Corp	107	38	35.5%	
	Enron Engineering & Operational Services	968	161	16.6%	
	Enron Global Markets	363	124	34.2%	
	Enron Industrial Markets	192	72	37.5%	
 	Enron Net Works	1560	680	43.6%	
	Enron Wholesale Services	13	1	7.7%	
	Wholesale EES	35	29	82.9%	
					
 	EWS - Consolidated	5138	1717	33.4%	


Our target was to have all evaluations completed by August 31 (we had hoped that all below VP's would be done by August 17). At year end we achieved close to 90% completion of written evaluations. The HR team are working hard to help their clients get these finalised, but I would appreciate all of your help in chasing this process to a successful conclusion.

At today's all employee meeting during the Q&A,  someone asked a question about Enron's involvement in Mexico.  The lady that responded to the question mentioned that they are looking for good people to staff the Monterrey, MX office.  

I looked at the Enron jobs listing but found no entries for Mexico.  Do you know how I could find out more about opportunities in Mexico?  If you could give me a name or number that would be great.  (I have no idea who my HR rep or if he or she would know anything about international positions).

Attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001.  The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.  A few highlights from this report:

The employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000).
Terminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.
Our ""contribution loss"" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL).
Let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data.

- Dave is incredibly valuable to our business.
- He lives in the most expensive city in the country.
- He has made Enron $90MM, most of which could not have closed if he lived in Houston or Portland.
- He is sitting on (like the rest of us) a lot of out of the money calls.

I think the following is appropriate:

Base: $200 + $15 COLA
Signing: $100
Equity: $300 (50/50)

David Parquet is currently on an employment agreement which expires on 12/1/2001.  Chris would like to be proactive in signing Dave up again for another 2 years.  

Dave's current contract details are:

Equity:		$100,000 equity (50/50) on 1/1/00
Equity:		$100,000 equity (50/50) on 1/1/01

Chris is proposing:

Base:  		$215,000 (or $200,000 with a COLA payment of $15,000 for each year of term)
Signing: 	$100,000
Equity:		$350,000 (50/50)

Hi Louise,

Congratulations on your baby and welcome back.  

I'm preparing the agenda for Enron's annual management conference again this year.  I was hoping I could ask for your insight as I'm compiling the program.

This year's conference theme plays off of our new vision, ""Becoming the World's Leading Company.""  However, the feeling at Enron is quite different this year because of the depressed stock price, California, India, Broadband, etc.  I'd welcome your thoughts on what the tone for the conference should be, i.e. subdued optimism, reenergizing, etc.

On a related subject, Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling will both have an hour on the agenda to speak.  This is in response to feedback from employees saying they want to hear more from each of them.  Afterall, they are both top notch industry speakers.  Rather than have them give a current ""state of the company"" address, I intend to have them focus on bigger company, industry or market topics.  I'd love your thoughts on this as well.  (I believe Jeff needs to lay out a plan for achieving our vision, and as an economist, Ken could give valuable insight into what's happening in the market.)

Finally, I'd welcome any ideas for an outside corporate speaker.  I'd very much like to have someone from a corporation that 1.) Enron people admire; and 2.) has undergone some difficult period in their company's history.  Jeff personally extended an invitation to Steve Ballmer from Microsoft, but he is unable to attend.  Is there someone you think would be interesting?

I truly appreciate any consideration you can give this issue.  I look forward to your thoughts and ideas.

Still working on Heizenrader, Richter and Belden - Michelle and I have been in discussions.  

The only concern (nothing on the numbers) is the legal issue that West Power currently faces from California.

I will keep you posted!

Do you need more from me on how we would structure the Jean deal if we did it? Seems unlikely based on below we will be able to.

Louise:

I spoke to Texaco today and put forth the following alternatives:  (1) remove Randy and put Jean in his place (I did offer to consider paying Randy out of his contract), (2) transfer all Texaco/Enron employees to Bridgeline without the ability for them to get paid out and walk away when the Texaco/Chevron merger occurs.  

Texaco strongly....no violently....opposes installing Jean as President, as they feel that everyone would quit - and no doubt many would.  My counter was that many of these people may quit anyway once the Texaco merger occurs, so we are in the same spot but with a President that is committed to the company.  My personal feeling is that we would also loose a number of the Enron folks, but we could recover, and may be better off.

I'm not sure we have a legal case to force Randy out, especially given Texaco's violent opposition.  However,  the threat of Jean as President seems to have a good deal of motivational power.  Jack Abadie committed to propose the following to Texaco in his meeting in NYC next week:

1.	All employees become Bridgeline employees now.
2.	Texaco employees get paid by Texaco their severance as follows:  (half when the merger occurs, the remainder after 12 - 24 months.
3.	If Texaco employees leave they loose the unpaid severance.

I am going to develop our legal position to see what leverage we have (or don't have).  I do have the ""open cost issues"" as a bargaining chip, but would like to drive this to a crisis point before playing that card.

I have a bet with Texaco that I can have the Bridgeline benefits plan in place by the end of the month.  Jeannie Slone is committed to this goal.
Also, I have not yet relayed the Texaco conversation with Jean and would like to hold off to see how this plays out.

Regards,
Brian

Do you remember Steve Vavrik?  Wants to move back to the East Coast.  Can you offer him anything in that region.  Remember he has a power plant background.  Perhaps with Rahil's fuel cell opp, or at Brooklyn Navy Yards?

Thought that culture management meeting was actually quite useful.  The ""Ken & Jeff"" pres is woeful, so we need to keep working our bit so there's something interesting to say.

Steve's resigned, going back to Boston where his wife has a job.  I said I'd see whether NA can use him or EES, (he's not keen to leave the company).  I also asked him to talk to Chris McKey re metals in New York.  (Chris, perhaps you could give him a call if he doesn't).

He is likely to end up at Calpine, Intergen or Dynegy if we can't place him.

Ms. Kitchen,

  Thank you for your response and the wise words to read more HBS studies!  I appreciate your honest answers and sound advice.  I am extremely interested in Enron Broadband for opportunities this fall.  Do you know of anyone there I could talk to about roles for MBA's, opportunities, the culture, and what roles MBA's play?  Thanks again for your time and I look forward to talking with you more.

Sincerely,

Chad Storlie

Chad,

Answers to questions (clearly not Enron answers but my own personal
views)

1. The areas you are looking at are not directly commercial and this
should be something you consider.  Essentially you may wish to consider
a consultancy company which is much more akin to your interests which
are not our core competencies.  You need to decide whether you wish to
pursue a commercial career or not - decide what your risk profile is, a
consultant role is low reward, low risk and commercial player has a
high/risk reward profile.
2. Driven, enthusiastic, hard working, highly analytical, personable and
motivated.
3. Not having an MBA personally, I find this one simple to answer.  Too
much occupation with trying to apply theory to practice / not seeing the
wood for the trees (english expression).
4. Get some practical experience.
5. More case studies (Harvard Business).

Good Luck.

I talked with Jeanie Slone today regarding the project  you'd like me to work on for the next few months.  I told Jeanie I will be  able to start on August 13th.  (I will be out of town August 1-4th, then  again August 7-10th.)  I would sure appreciate your calling or e-mailing me  before the 13th with a quick overview of what you see my role in this transition  before I show up on the 13th--what needs to be done, issues, what has been done  to date, who I will be working with, etc.
 
My home number is 281-482-3920
Mobile is 713-854-4380
E-mail address is shak@ev1.net .  
 
    Thanks!

Swerzbin submitted comments on Monday;  feedback will be given to him today - some met some not;  Mike's comments on our feedback due on Monday;  should be in a position to execute next week.
Heizenrader is good on numbers and still talking language.  Final issues relate to language about breaking laws or regulations and all of the accusations that are out there about Enron and it's employees breaking laws and regulations.  Michele Cash has talked to Sanders and Haedicke about this stuff.  Tim H., Michele, Amy Fitzpatrick (HR Generalist in PDX) and I met today.  We think that we have arrived at language that will work for everyone.  Ball is in Michele's court to turn another draft around to us.
Belden - I am good on the numbers.  I have have concerns about indemnity against California and West Power related lawsuits.  I also want to formalize the arrangement that I have with Haedicke with respect to Enron covering my legal fees associated with the west power investigations.  Michele is going to take a cut at some language.  She also needs to convince me that I am covered by the Directors and Officers indemnifications which are part of Enron's bylaws and Delaware law.
Richter - he's been lame about giving me his comments.  I've been lame about riding him on it.  I will do that today.
Wolfe - Greg currently is considering offers from Calpine, AEP, and Enron.  AEP is offering significantly more money.  Greg needs to decide where he wants to work and who he wants to work with.  There is a very real chance that we lose him.  However, we've shown his a great bid, so we will just have to get by if he leaves for a lot of money.  When I say a lot, he is talking about guaranteed 600k per year, roughly.
Motley - has declined our offer.  The total numbers looked good, but he doesn't like Enron options.  If we took his Option value and put it into cash or restricted stock he would be done.  I mentioned it to John and he didn't want to do that.  On the one hand, if that will get him done I think that it's a great outcome.  On the other, we showed him some good numbers and I respect the fact that John wants to keep things consistent.  Tough call.  He did mention that if Enron's Treasury department would let him gamma trade his options withodd lots and no margin requirement that he would take the options.  He has a legitimate point that he has no way of assuring that he can achieve the value of the options.  It's also very hard to argue with an options trader on this point.

Yes.  Azurix caused us a big headache, because the contract they did in 2000 was weak, but Mike stuck it out, did what we asked him to do to get it done in the end.

Professional
Integrity
Relationship-Oriented
Understands big deal processes - legal, relationship, negotiations, politics, etc.
Would need some hard-core junior commercial people around him - to id the value/risk/arbs in deals

Louise,

Thanks for the quick response.  I have considered the offer, and feel that a Director's position would not be of interest to me.

If something else comes up, do let me know.

Catherine has been in Global inance for Enron Americas for the past year. She has been ranked a Category 1 during year-end 2000 and mid-year 2001 PRC. She is responsible for the financial modeling of all the greenfield project development opportunities being pursued by Origination. She has learned to articulate the banks' concerns with the projects and equipment to be financed within E-Next and other structures to both the originators and accounting. The successful effort Origination has had this year with developments has provided tremendous document flow which has allowed Catherine to develop her document review skills from both a financing and commercial perspective. The growth in maturity she has experienced driven by her deal flow has made her one of the core ""go to"" junior people in my group when a deal calls for financial analysis. She has been performing at the manager level for six months and is seen as a leader among the junior staff in the group.

Many of you know Dale Furrow already.  For those who don't, he ran our structuring group in Portland from late 1997 until the middle of 1999.  He's an Army Grad, Wharton Grad, went through the Associate program and left Enron as a Director to join Entergy's Asset Development group working for Jeff Roberts.  He recently tendered his resignation at Entergy and is on the job market.  He is leaving Entergy on good terms -- he simply decided that he doesn't like working there for a variety of reasons.

Dale has a great background for many of the EES/EWS work that we are trying to do now.  He was an AWESOME structurer.  He ""gets"" trading.  He was responsible for the development and implementation of Entergy Power Marketing's risk systems.  In short, he would be a great catch for us.

I will be in Houston Monday and Tuesday of next week.  I will interview Dale on Tuesday.  I know that Louise and John are in PRC on Tuesday, so they would have to do it later.  Perhaps the rest of us could meet him on Tuesday.  

I don't yet have a specific job nailed down for him.  I think that he could run a URM desk (east or west).  He could run the site profile, asset profile, dsm group.  I would expect that he would expect to come in at a VP level.  I know that's a high bar and hard to do here, which is why I would want this group of people to meet with him.  I have asked Debra Davidson to contact each of you to coordinate these interviews.

Thanks,
Tim","many of you know dale furrow already.  for those who don't, he ran our structuring group in portland from late 1997 until the middle of 1999.  he's an army grad, wharton grad, went through the associate program and left enron as a director to join entergy's asset development group working for jeff roberts.  he recently tendered his resignation at entergy and is on the job market.  he is leaving entergy on good terms -- he simply decided that he doesn't like working there for a variety of reasons.

As Brian is away on vacation, I thought you may be able to assist me.

Brian Redmond does not have responsibilities in his profile for the MD prc.  I took Laura Luce's profile and changed the region to Texas and added Tech Services.  Do you think this is appropriate or can you offer any changes?

It has come to our attention that confidential information was disclosed after the EWS PRC meeting this past Tuesday.  We are very concerned about any breach of confidentiality as it relates to discussions in our PRC meetings.

The PRC process is very important at Enron, and it is absolutely critical that confidentiality is maintained throughout the process.  It goes without saying that information discussed during a PRC meeting should never be shared outside the meeting.  The integrity of the entire PRC process is at risk if we cannot trust what is said in the room during a meeting will stay in the room.

The mid-year PRC process is still ongoing and many of you will be attending final Enron-wide meetings later this month.  The process is not complete until these final meetings are concluded, at which time individual feedback should be given.  That feedback should be summary information only specific to the individual.  Information should never be shared about others' ratings or specific comments made about a person.

Please see either one of us if you wish to discuss this further.

Louise:

I got a couple urgent messages today from Jody Pierce and Fred Mitro asking about allocation of the group's origination.

Attached please find our official list (a copy of which I gave you last week, but I have made a few updates).

In making these allocations for purposes of the PRC process, however, I want to note a couple of things. First, I have listed the individual in the group who worked most with me on each of the subject transactions. Each deal, however, involved many members of the group, and I don't want to diminish other's contributions to these deals. The deals we have closed have been very complicated, and have all involved many months of structuring in order to bring them to the point of creating value for the Company.

Second, the deal sheet does not recognize the significant development milestones we have reached with respect to Florida and Georgia in particular.

Lastly, you will note that I have left my name off the list. I have done this for two reasons: because I have worked on all these deals, and because I want to motivate people in the group by providing them recognition for their efforts. The specific contribution made by the individuals on this list varies by the skill set of these individuals. Some co-leads have played a more technical role, while others have played more of a commercial role. 

I will be prepared to go through this list in detail on Monday, and provide a more comprehensive explanation of the listed individual's contributions. I will also be prepared to talk about the contributions to our development efforts that others have made.

Please let me know if you'd like to talk about this list this weekend. You can page me at 1-888-876-3206.

Regards,

Ben

Louise,

Are we ok to go forward on Neil?  Last time we talked you seemed ok with internal transfers as long as there was no increase in pay or title.  Not sure on the relocations from London in light of the current situation.  May want to hold on them until things settle down and we know the impact on the Houston staffing.  My guess is that we will have a lot of very strong people in Houston available.

Thanks,

Robert

Are we still OK to move forward with internal transfers?  Neil is in Houston, Elizabeth is an American who rotated most recently to London, and I can't seem to find Posey in SAP (so not sure of her status!).

Amy -

Can you confirm whether we have put a hold on all internal transfers.  I heard this but wanted to confirm.  I have been approached by several very dtrong people in other groups and I do think we need to address how we handle in light of any potential upcoming reductions.

Specifically, there is one individual still in Broadband, Neil Carpino, that everyone would like to have join Berney/Edith/Terry.  There are two individuals in Europe, Posey Martinez and Elizabeth Johnston that would be good fits as well.  I am holding off on all moves until there is more clarity.

Any info or insight you might provide would be helpful.

Thanks,
RH","louise,

Faith:

Here is a spreadsheet that summarizes the individual contributions for West Power Middle Market and West Power Services.  A couple thoughts:

	-	Please make sure the dollars are distributed to the individuals so credit is given where credit is due.  Although I wish I made the money currently indicated in 		the tables, obviously the numbers represent the total for all of us.

	-	Services Desk P&L is the responsibility of Greg Wolfe and he is a leading originator for the coverage group.  The attached table reflects the sum of both 		groups.

	-	Some of the contributors to Middle Market West Power are non-commercial (Cocke, Rawson) while others are not technically in the Middle Market Group 		although the P&L they generate is (Mainzer, Scholtes).

	-	I am concerned that the origination tracking taking place is going to overstate the importance of origination and underestimate the importance of other 	Middle 		Market ""Coverage"" behaviors such as number of Master Agreements put in place, number of new accounts brought in, etc.  A couple of fairly easy metrics 		would be:  1)  number of EEI/ISDA contracts; 2)  number of transactions;  3)  number of different counter parties transacting; and 4)  number of EOL clients 		brought in.  Quantifying these few items should be relatively simple and go a long way toward measuring coverage.   

		We currently measure these coverage metrics and it is my understanding that other Middle Marketing Groups do as well.  It should be relatively 			simple to begin assimilating this data and including it in the data you are collecting for all of ENA Middle Market.  

		Perhaps non-Middle Market Origination Groups can measure certain behaviors as well.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Hi Louise,

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

?	by team
?	by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
?	by Originator (sorted by value)
?	Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
?	Top 10 Originators- Gas
?	Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!

Dear Louise and Faith
 
I had a review of the spreadsheet and noticed an error in allocation of value for the Central Maine Power deal.  The $5 MM of orig value for this deal was incorrectly allocated to Jeff Ader.  This value should be allocated to myself and George Wood (Woody), who worked with me on the deal.   As for the appropriate split between me and Woody, I think Dave Duran and Ed Baughman should make the call on that (i believe both Dave and Ed are on holiday this week).
 
In addition, I had one other deal that did not make it next to my name.  This deal involved selling ICAP in NEPOOL to New England Power Company and had orig value of $40,000.   I am trying to find a deal number for this.  As we discussed Faith, it is possible that the deal for $40k under Jeff Ader's name is in fact this deal, in which case this value should be reallocated to me.
 
Regards
John

	Hi Louise,

	As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

	We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

	?       by team

	?       by Originator (sorted alphabetically)

	?       by Originator (sorted by value)

	?       Top 10 Overall Originators by Value

	?       Top 10 Originators- Gas

	?       Top 10 Originators- Power

	An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

	We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

	Please let me know if you need any additional information!

","dear louise and faith
 
i had a review of the spreadsheet and noticed an error in allocation of value for the central maine power deal.  the $5 mm of orig value for this deal was incorrectly allocated to jeff ader.  this value should be allocated to myself and george wood (woody), who worked with me on the deal.   as for the appropriate split between me and woody, i think dave duran and ed baughman should make the call on that (i believe both dave and ed are on holiday this week).
 
in addition, i had one other deal that did not make it next to my name.  this deal involved selling icap in nepool to new england power company and had orig value of $40,000.   i am trying to find a deal number for this.  as we discussed faith, it is possible that the deal for $40k under jeff ader's name is in fact this deal, in which case this value should be reallocated to me.
 
regards
john

Three blondes died in an accident trying to jump the Grand Canyon. They
are
  at the pearly gates of Heaven. St. Peter tells them that they can enter
the
  gates only if they can answer one simple religious question.

 The question posed by St. Peter is - ""What is Easter""?

 The first blonde replies, ""Oh, that's easy! It's the holiday in November
  when we all get together, eat turkey and are thankful.""

 ""Wrong!, you are not welcome here, I'm afraid. You must go to the other
  place!"" replies St. Peter. Then he turns to the second blonde, and asks
her
  the same question - ""What is Easter?""

 The second blonde replies, ""Easter is the holiday in December when we put
  up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus.""

 St. Peter looks at the second blonde, bangs his head on the pearly Gates
  in disgust and tells her she's wrong and will have to join her friend in
  the other place; she is not welcome in Heaven.

 He then peers over his glasses at the third blonde and asks, ""Do YOU know
  what Easter is?""

 The third blonde smiles confidently and looks St. Peter in the eyes, ""I
  know what Easter is.""

 ""Oh?"" says St. Peter, incredulously.

 ""Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish
celebration
  of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and
  Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one  of his
  disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the
  side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with  nails
  through his hands and feet. He was buried in a nearby cave which was
sealed
  off by a large boulder.""

 St. Peter smiles broadly with delight.

 Then the third blonde continues ... ""Every year the boulder is moved aside
  so that Jesus can come out and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six
  more weeks of winter!

  the same question - ""what is easter?""

 the second blonde replies, ""easter is the holiday in december when we put
  up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of jesus.""

 st. peter looks at the second blonde, bangs his head on the pearly gates
  in disgust and tells her she's wrong and will have to join her friend in
  the other place; she is not welcome in heaven.

 he then peers over his glasses at the third blonde and asks, ""do you know
  what easter is?""

 the third blonde smiles confidently and looks st. peter in the eyes, ""i
  know what easter is.""

 ""oh?"" says st. peter, incredulously.

 ""easter is the christian holiday that coincides with the jewish
celebration
  of passover. jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and
  jesus was later deceived and turned over to the romans by one  of his
  disciples. the romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the
  side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with  nails
  through his hands and feet. he was buried in a nearby cave which was
sealed
  off by a large boulder.""

 st. peter smiles broadly with delight.

 then the third blonde continues ... ""every year the boulder is moved aside
  so that jesus can come out and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six
  more weeks of winter!

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

Ok,Y'all, Texas has given all those complainers plenty of time to get used
to the results. After seeing the whiners along the inauguration route, We
Texicans have decided that we might just take matters into our own hands.
Here is a solution:

#1: Let Al Gore become President of the United States (all 49
states).

#2: George W. Bush becomes the President of the Republic of
Texas.

So what does Texas have to do to survive as a Republic?

NASA in Houston, Texas (we will control the space industry).

We refine over 85% of the gasoline in the United States

Defense Industry (we have over 65% of it). The term ""Don't mess
with
Texas,"" will take on a whole new meaning.

Oil - we can supply all the oil that the Republic of ! Texas will
need
for the next 300 years.
Yankee states? Sorry about that.

Natural Gas - Again we have all we need and it's too bad about
those
northern states. Al Gore will figure a way to keep them warm....

Computer Industry - we currently lead the nation in producing
computer chips and communications: Small places like Texas
Instruments,
Dell Computer, EDS, Raytheon, National Semiconductor, Motorola,
Intel,
AMD, Atmel, Applied Materials, Ball Semiconductor, Dallas
Semiconductor,
Delphi, Nortel, Alcatel, Etc,Etc.

The list goes on and on.

Health Centers - We have the largest research centers for Cancer
research, the best burn centers and the top trauma units in the
world, and
other large health planning centers.


We have enough colleges to keep us going: UT, Texas A&M, Rice,
SMU,
University of Houston, Baylor, UNT, Texas Women's University,<B! Retc.
Ivy grows better in the south anyway.

We h! ave a ready supply of workers (just open the border when we
need
some more).

We have control of the paper industry, toilet paper, plastics,
insurance, etc.

In case of a foreign invasion; we have the Texas National Guard
and
the Texas Air National Guard. We don't have an army but since
everybody
down here has at least six rifles and a pile of ammunition, we
can raise
an army in 24 hours if we need it. If the situation really gets
bad, we can
always call Department of Public Safety and ask them to send
over a couple
Texas Rangers. As a last resort we can always raise an army of
Mexicans.

We are totally self sufficient in beef, poultry, hogs and
vegetable
produce and everybody down here knows how to cook them so that
they taste
good.

Don't need any food.

This just names a few of the items that will keep the Republic
of
Texas in good shape. There isn't a thing out there that we need
a! nd don't
have.

Now to the rest of the United States under President Gore: Since
you
won't have the refineries to get gas for your cars, only
President Gore
will be able to drive around in his 9 mile per gallon SUV. The
rest of the
United States will have to walk or ride bikes.

You won't have any TV as the space center in Houston will cut
off
your communications. You won't have any natural gas to heat your
homes
but since Mr. Gore has predicted global warming, you will not
need the gas.

Just a few notes on REAL election results:

Total Counties won by Bush: 2,434
Total Counties won by Gore: 677

Population of counties won by Bush: 143 million.
Population of counties won by Gore: 127 million

Square miles of country won by Bush: 2,427,000
Square miles of country won by Gore: 580,000

States won by Bush: 29
States won by Gore: 19

And an even more remarkable finding....

Avera! ge Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Bush:<BR!0.1
Average Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Gore:
13.2

Researchers found one more interesting fact that might help
explain
these disparate murder rates. Gun ownership in the counties won
by Mr.
Bush is much higher than in the counties won by Mr. Gore.

Subject: Dave Barry's thoughts on CA's electrical storage


Feb. 2, 2001, 8:06PM

The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite 

By DAVE BARRY  

When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California, our  
reaction, as concerned Americans, is: Ha ha!  

No, seriously, we are alarmed. Because history teaches us that whatever  
happens to California -- smog, road rage, tofu, coffee that is mainly air, 
cell  phones, the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive, Shirley 
MacLaine,  people taking in-line skating seriously, grandmothers sporting new 
and  flagrantly inappropriate bosoms -- eventually happens to the rest of the 
nation.  Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage 
and see if  we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and 
change the  subject.  

Our first question is: What, exactly, is electricity? When we look in our  
Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia, we see that ""electricity"" is defined  as a 
""class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge  and from 
the interaction of charges."" What does this mean, in lay-person's  terms?  

It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big, fat  
dope. Because we know from our junior-high-school science training that  
electricity is actually a fast-moving herd of electrons, which are tiny  
one-celled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside 
a  double-A battery, where they die within minutes.  

Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited. This was  
proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during 
a  thunderstorm and was almost killed. Encouraged by this success, Franklin 
went on  to conduct many more electrical experiments, including rolling a 
hoop in a  thunderstorm, playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing 
somersaults in a  thunderstorm.  

Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister  
Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm, leaving the authorities with no 
choice  but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France.  Nevertheless, 
Franklin had proved an important scientific point, which is  that electricity 
originates inside clouds. There it forms into lightning, which  is attracted 
to the earth by golfers.  

After entering the ground, the electricity hardens into coal, which, when 
dug  up by power companies and burned in big ovens called ""generators,""  
turns back into electricity, which is sent in the form of ""volts""  (also 
known as ""watts,"" or ""rpm"" for short) through special  wires with birds 
sitting on them to consumers' homes, where it is transformed by  TV sets into 
commercials for beer, which passes through the consumers and back  into the 
ground, thus completing what is known as a ""circuit.""  

But enough technical talk. The problem is that California is running out of  
electricity. The situation is so bad that in some hospitals, they don't have  
enough electricity to power those electric-shock paddles that get people's  
hearts started again; instead, the doctors and nurses have to hold hands, 
scuff  their feet across the carpet in unison, then shout ""CLEAR!"" as they  
touch the patient's chest.  

Who is responsible for California's electricity shortage? You could blame 
the  power companies; or you could blame environmental wackos; or you could 
blame the  entertainment industry, which uses more than 750 billion watts of 
electricity  per day just to blow-dry the hair of the cast of Dawson's Creek; 
or you  could blame (why not?) the Firestone tire company. But you would be 
wrong.  Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity 
shortage is:  college students.  

I base this statement on widespread observation of my son, who is a college  
student, and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium. If my son 
is  in a room, then every electrical device within 200 yards of that room -- 
every  light, computer, television, stereo, video game, microwave oven, etc. 
-- will be  running. My son doesn't even have to turn the devices on; they 
activate  themselves spontaneously in response to his presence.  

Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in  
California, which according to my research is (EDITOR: Please insert number

the rest of us should tell california to go fly a kite 

by dave barry  

when we consider the serious electricity shortage in california, our  
reaction, as concerned americans, is: ha ha!  

no, seriously, we are alarmed. because history teaches us that whatever  
happens to california -- smog, road rage, tofu, coffee that is mainly air, 
cell  phones, the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive, shirley 
maclaine,  people taking in-line skating seriously, grandmothers sporting new 
and  flagrantly inappropriate bosoms -- eventually happens to the rest of the 
nation.  thus it is vital that we analyze the california electricity shortage 
and see if  we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and 
change the  subject.  

our first question is: what, exactly, is electricity? when we look in our  
microsoft encarta encyclopedia, we see that ""electricity"" is defined  as a 
""class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge  and from 
the interaction of charges."" what does this mean, in lay-person's  terms?  

it means that whoever wrote the microsoft encarta encyclopedia is a big, fat  
dope. because we know from our junior-high-school science training that  
electricity is actually a fast-moving herd of electrons, which are tiny  
one-celled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside 
a  double-a battery, where they die within minutes.  

electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited. this was  
proved in the famous experiment wherein benjamin franklin flew a kite during 
a  thunderstorm and was almost killed. encouraged by this success, franklin 
went on  to conduct many more electrical experiments, including rolling a 
hoop in a  thunderstorm, playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing 
somersaults in a  thunderstorm.  

finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing mister  
pooter rides the pony in a thunderstorm, leaving the authorities with no 
choice  but to arrest him and make him ambassador to france.  nevertheless, 
franklin had proved an important scientific point, which is  that electricity 
originates inside clouds. there it forms into lightning, which  is attracted 
to the earth by golfers.  

after entering the ground, the electricity hardens into coal, which, when 
dug  up by power companies and burned in big ovens called ""generators,""  
turns back into electricity, which is sent in the form of ""volts""  (also 
known as ""watts,"" or ""rpm"" for short) through special  wires with birds 
sitting on them to consumers' homes, where it is transformed by  tv sets into 
commercials for beer, which passes through the consumers and back  into the 
ground, thus completing what is known as a ""circuit.""  

but enough technical talk. the problem is that california is running out of  
electricity. the situation is so bad that in some hospitals, they don't have  
enough electricity to power those electric-shock paddles that get people's  
hearts started again; instead, the doctors and nurses have to hold hands, 
scuff  their feet across the carpet in unison, then shout ""clear!"" as they  
touch the patient's chest.  

who is responsible for california's electricity shortage? you could blame 
the  power companies; or you could blame environmental wackos; or you could 
blame the  entertainment industry, which uses more than 750 billion watts of 
electricity  per day just to blow-dry the hair of the cast of dawson's creek; 
or you  could blame (why not?) the firestone tire company. but you would be 
wrong.  because obviously the real cause of the california electricity 
shortage is:  college students.  

i base this statement on widespread observation of my son, who is a college  
student, and who personally consumes more electricity than belgium. if my son 
is  in a room, then every electrical device within 200 yards of that room -- 
every  light, computer, television, stereo, video game, microwave oven, etc. 
-- will be  running. my son doesn't even have to turn the devices on; they 
activate  themselves spontaneously in response to his presence.  

now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in  
california, which according to my research is (editor: please insert number 
of  college students in california) and you see my point, which is (editor: 
please  insert my point).  

the question is: what can the rest of us do to help our fellow 
countrypersons  in california? the answer is that we can send them our spare 
electricity. just  imagine what would happen if all the households in this 
great and generous  nation got out their extension cords and connected them 
together, forming a  giant electrical ""chain of helping"" across the fruited 
plain to the  golden state! millions of people would be turned into generous 
smoking lumps of  carbon, that's what. so maybe we should go with plan b. 
this involves building a  really, really, really big kite.

The following came from an anonymous mother in Austin, TX. Let's just

say she has an interesting life with very imaginative children.

=20

Things I've learned from my children (Honest and No Kidding):

1. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2,000 sq foot house

4 inches deep.

2. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller

blades, they can ignite.

3. A 3-year-old's voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded

restaurant.=20

4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong

enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman

cape. It is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four walls of

a 20X20 foot room.

5. You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When

using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few

times before you get a hit.=20

5a. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way.

6. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit

by a ceiling fan.

7. When you hear the toilet flush and the words ""Uh-oh"", it's already

too late.

8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it.

9. A six-year-old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a

36-year-old man says they can only do it in the movies. A magnifying

glass can start a fire even on an overcast day.

the following came from an anonymous mother in austin, tx. let's just

say she has an interesting life with very imaginative children.

=20

things i've learned from my children (honest and no kidding):

1. a king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2,000 sq foot house

4 inches deep.

2. if you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller

blades, they can ignite.

3. a 3-year-old's voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded

restaurant.=20

4. if you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong

enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing batman underwear and a superman

cape. it is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four walls of

a 20x20 foot room.

5. you should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. when

using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few

times before you get a hit.=20

5a. a ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way.

6. the glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit

by a ceiling fan.

7. when you hear the toilet flush and the words ""uh-oh"", it's already

too late.

8. brake fluid mixed with clorox makes smoke, and lots of it.

9. a six-year-old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a

36-year-old man says they can only do it in the movies. a magnifying

glass can start a fire even on an overcast day.

10. certain lego's will pass through the digestive tract of a

four-year-old.

11. play dough and microwave should never be used in the same sentence.

12. super glue is forever.

13. no matter how much jell-o you put in a swimming pool you still can't

walk on water.

14. pool filters do not like jell-o.

15. vcr's do not eject pb&j sandwiches even though tv commercials show they
do.

16. garbage bags do not make good parachutes.

17. marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving.

18. you probably do not want to know what that odor is.

19. always look in the oven before you turn it on. plastic toys do not

like ovens.

20. the fire department in austin has a 5 minute response time.

21. the spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earth worms

dizzy. it will however make cats dizzy and cats throw up twice their

body weight when dizzy.

TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES

This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing. America: The Good 
Neighbor.  

Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable 
editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television 
commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as 
printed in the Congressional Record.

The comments at the end are not mine but I agree with them wholeheartedly.

""This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most 
generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.  

Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of 
the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and 
forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying even 
the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.

When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who 
propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the 
streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.

When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries in 
to help.

This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes. Nobody 
helped.

The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into 
discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about 
the decadent, warmongering Americans. I'd like to see just one of those 
countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build 
its own airplane. Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal 
the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? If so, why 
don't they fly them?  Why do all the International lines except Russia fly 
American Planes? 

Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the 
moon?

You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.

You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles. 

You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon - not once, 
but several times - and safely home again. 

You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store 
window for everybody to look at.  Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued 
and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are 
breaking Canadian laws, are getting America dollars from ma and pa at home to 
spend here. 

When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through 
age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad 
and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both 
are still broke.

I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other 
people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to 
the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during 
the San Francisco earthquake. 

Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired 
of hearing them get kicked around.

They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they 
are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their 
present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of those. 

Stand proud, America! Wear it proudly!!""

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is one of the best editorials that I have ever read regarding the United 
States. It is nice that one man realizes it. I only wish that the rest of the 
world would realize it. We are always blamed for everything, and never even 
get a thank you for the things we do. I would hope that each of you would 
send this to as many people as you can and  emphasize that they should send 
it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on 
the web. I am just a single American that has read this, I SURE HOPE THAT A 
LOT MORE READ IT SOON.

 Political  Philosophies: Explained in Simple ""Two-Cow"" Terms
with an Update for the  state of California

Socialism: You have two cows. You keep one, but  must
give the other to your neighbor.

Communism: You have two cows.  The government takes
both and provides you with milk.

Fascism: You  have two cows. The government takes
both and sells you the  milk.

Bureaucracy: You have two cows. The government
takes them,  shoots one, milks the other, pays you
for the milk, and then pours it down  the drain.

Dictatorship: You have two cows. The government
takes both,  then shoots you.

Capitalism: You have two cows. You sell one and buy
a  bull.

Democracy: You have two cows. The government taxes
you to the  point that you must sell them both to
support a man in a foreign country who  has only one
cow, which was a gift from your own  government.

Corporation: You have two cows. You lay one off,
force the  other to produce the milk of four cows, then
act surprised when it drops  dead.

California: You have two cows. The state tells you how
to milk  your cows, when to milk your cows, how much to
milk your cows and the most  that you can charge for the
milk. You go broke and sell the cows. The state  calls you
greedy and blames you for the current milk shortage.  "," political  philosophies: explained in simple ""two-cow"" terms

There was an old guy wandering around the supermarket calling out,
""Crisco, Crissscccoooo!""

Finally a store clerk approached. ""Sir, the Crisco is in aisle five.""

""Oh,"" replied the old gentleman, ""I'm not looking for cooking Crisco, I
am calling my wife.""

""Your wife is named ""Crisco?""

""Nah,"" he answered, ""I only call her that when we're out in public.""

""Oh?  What do you call her when you are at home?""


""Lard ass.""","
